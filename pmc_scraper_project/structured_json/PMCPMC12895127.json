Initial lab results showed ALT 775 U/L, AST 483 U/L, GGT 113 U/L, and ALP 181 U/L. After 2 weeks, worsening was observed with ALT 1080 U/L, AST 686 U/L, GGT 152 U/L, and ALP 214 U/L. Bilirubin, INR, and Albumin were not mentioned in the text. The clinical outcome was improved/discharged as the patient achieved spontaneous viral clearance and resolution of liver test abnormalities in less than 8 weeks, with no recurrence after 3 years. Suspected drug-induced liver injury was initially considered, but Hepatitis E virus was identified as the cause, with no specific drug implicated as the primary cause.",
