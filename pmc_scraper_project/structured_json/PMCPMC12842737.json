Lab results at admission show AST = 196 U/L and ALT = 261 U/L, with transaminases peaking in early May after the first hospitalization, as indicated in Figure 3. The text mentions that transaminases and GGT returned to normal by late June, but specific peak values for ALT, AST, and GGT are not explicitly stated beyond the admission values and the upward trend. Other lab values include albumin at 4.19 g/dL (normal range), and no mention of ALP, Bilirubin, or INR in the context of peak abnormalities. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged after cessation of bay leaf consumption and hepatoprotective treatment, with the patient discharged on 13 May 2024 and showing favorable evolution.",
