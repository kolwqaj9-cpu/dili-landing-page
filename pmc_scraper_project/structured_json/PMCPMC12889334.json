Peak liver enzyme values are clearly stated in the text and Table 1: ALT peaked at 712 U/L, AST at 532 U/L, ALP at 206 U/L, total bilirubin at 1.54 mg/dL with direct bilirubin at 0.61 mg/dL. INR and GGT are not mentioned in the text. Albumin is mentioned with a lowest value of 3.5 g/dL. The clinical outcome is described as full recovery with normalization of liver function tests by 30-day follow-up, so it is 'Improved/Discharged'. The extraction is based on explicit data from the case presentation and tables, providing high confidence.",
