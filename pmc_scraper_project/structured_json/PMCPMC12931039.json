The case presentation and Table 1 provide detailed longitudinal lab results. Peak AST was 987 U/L at 7 weeks after ART resumption, peak ALT was 968 U/L at the same time, ALP peaked at 270 U/L at 11 weeks, total bilirubin peaked at 1.8 mg/dL at 7 weeks, and transaminases normalized by week 11. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged as the patient achieved HBsAg loss and seroconversion. The suspected drug is bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (ART) as it triggered IRIS-HF.",
