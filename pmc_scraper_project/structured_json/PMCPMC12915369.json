The text mentions 'LFTs indicated acute hepatitis and cholestatic liver disease' but does not provide specific peak values for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, INR, or albumin. The patient was admitted to the hospital and received conservative management. By hospital day 11, LFT parameter levels normalized, and the patient was discharged. At follow-up, cholesterol levels improved without liver function deterioration. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged.",
