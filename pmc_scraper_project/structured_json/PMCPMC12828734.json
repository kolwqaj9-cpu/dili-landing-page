    "chain_of_thought": "[Article Type: Case Report] In this article, I found the following liver injury-related lab values and clinical outcomes: The text describes a human case report of a 68-year-old male with Mycobacterium avium complex infection. The case presentation section mentions that anti-mycobacterial therapy was discontinued seven months later due to drug-induced liver injury, but no specific liver function test values (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Bilirubin, INR, Albumin) are provided in the text. The clinical outcome mentions improvement after treatment initiation but discontinuation due to liver injury, with no follow-up after discontinuation. Since no lab values are explicitly stated, I will set them to null. The clinical outcome is described as improvement initially but discontinuation due to adverse effects, so I classify it as 'Improved/Discharged' based on the initial recovery mentioned.",
