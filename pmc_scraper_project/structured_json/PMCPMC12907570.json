Lab results include AST, ALT, and ALP elevations graded over time, with peak values inferred from grade descriptions: AST reached grade 3 (likely >5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), ALT reached grade 2 (likely >3 times ULN), and ALP reached grade 3 (likely >5 times ULN). Bilirubin, INR, GGT, and Albumin are not explicitly mentioned in the text. The clinical outcome is death due to liver failure.",
