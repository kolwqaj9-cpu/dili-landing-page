Lab results include peak values: ALT 271 U/L, AST 287 U/L, ALP >1000 U/L (specifically mentioned as >1000, with a later value of 1943 U/L during treatment), total bilirubin >12 mg/dL (with a later value of 9.6 mg/dL during treatment). GGT, INR, and Albumin are not mentioned in the text. Clinical outcome shows improvement after chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, with liver function tests normalizing at follow-up.",
