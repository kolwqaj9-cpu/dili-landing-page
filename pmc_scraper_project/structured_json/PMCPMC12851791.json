Lab results show peak ALT of 391.9 U/L, AST of 258.3 U/L, total bilirubin of 79.6 μmol/L, and direct bilirubin of 50.3 μmol/L at admission. Other liver function indicators like ALP, GGT, INR, and Albumin are not explicitly mentioned in the text. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged as the patient's jaundice subsided and liver function improved after treatment.",
