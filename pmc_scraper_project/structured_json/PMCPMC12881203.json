The text mentions severe ALF with excessive vasoplegia requiring high-dose vasopressors, but specific peak lab values for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Bilirubin, INR, and Albumin are not provided in the case presentation or results sections. The clinical outcome is described as the patient responding to standard medical treatment for ALF and being discharged 2 months after admission, indicating improvement. Therefore, lab results are set to null, and clinical outcome is 'Improved/Discharged'.",
