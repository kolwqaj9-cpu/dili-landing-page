The suspected drug causing liver injury is mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), as dysgeusia began shortly after its initiation and contributed to malnutrition and hepatic decompensation. From the text and tables, I extracted lab results: ALT is not mentioned, AST peak is 108 U/L, ALP peak is 302 U/L, GGT is not mentioned, Bilirubin peak is 1.7 mg/dL (total bilirubin), INR peak is 1.3, and Albumin lowest is 2.4 g/dL. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged, as the patient was discharged with nutritional counseling and showed weight regain and improved grip strength during follow-up.",
