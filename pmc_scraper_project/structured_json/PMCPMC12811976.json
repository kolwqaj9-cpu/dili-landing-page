The case presentation section provides specific lab values from May 2022 showing ALT 167 IU/L, AST 154 IU/L, GGT 147 IU/L, ALP 178 IU/L, with bilirubin, albumin, and INR reported as normal. Table 1 confirms these peak values and shows normalization after efavirenz withdrawal. The clinical outcome is clearly described as improvement with normalization of liver enzymes and other parameters after drug discontinuation, with the patient remaining clinically well.",
