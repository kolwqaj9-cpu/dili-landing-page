Peak lab values include ALT at 1,550.88 U/L, AST at 1,304.42 U/L, ALP at 297.9 U/L, total bilirubin at 213.6 umol/L, and later bilirubin increased to 432.2 umol/L. INR and albumin are not mentioned. The suspected drug is efavirenz. After discontinuation of efavirenz and treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, liver enzymes normalized over a year, indicating improvement. The clinical outcome is improved/discharged.",
