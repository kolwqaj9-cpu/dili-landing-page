Liver function tests were mentioned preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperatively, total bilirubin was 17.27 mg/dL and albumin was 3.0 g/dL. Postoperatively, on POD 15, total bilirubin was 1.23 mg/dL, AST was 18 IU/L, ALT was 39 IU/L, and INR was 1.00. After developing GVHD, liver function declined, but specific peak values for ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, INR, and albumin during the acute phase were not explicitly provided in the text. The clinical outcome was death due to multiorgan failure on POD 30.",
