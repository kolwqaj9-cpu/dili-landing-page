From Table 1, I extracted peak lab values: ALT 171 U/L, AST not mentioned, ALP 673 IU/L (though text mentions 750 U/L earlier, I use the table value as it's more specific), GGT 1295 U/L, Bilirubin <5 µmol/L, Albumin 45 g/L. INR is not mentioned. The clinical outcome is improved after ketamine cessation, as stated in the text: 'Following cessation of ketamine use, the patient demonstrated biochemical improvement' and 'Our patient similarly showed significant biochemical recovery following strict abstinence.'",
