Peak lab values are mentioned in the case presentation: ALT of 3399 U/L, AST of 2612 U/L, ALP of 421 U/L, bilirubin of 154 umol/L (with initial bilirubin at 81 umol/L, but 154 umol/L is higher and likely the peak). INR and albumin are not mentioned in the text. The clinical outcome is improved, as liver enzymes normalized after treatment with ruxolitinib and steroids, and the patient was discharged without restarting immunotherapy.",
