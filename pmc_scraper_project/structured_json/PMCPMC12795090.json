The case presentation and Table 1 provide specific lab values: ALT peak of 134 U/L (in 2012.8), AST peak of 121 U/L (initial presentation), ALP not mentioned, GGT not mentioned, Bilirubin not mentioned, INR not mentioned, Albumin not mentioned. The clinical outcome is progressive muscle weakness and persistent hematuria, but no mention of death or liver transplant; the patient is alive with ongoing symptoms, so outcome is 'Improved/Discharged' as she was discharged and managed, though with chronic issues.",
