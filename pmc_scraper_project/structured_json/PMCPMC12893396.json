However, upon careful reading of the entire text, including the Case Presentation and Results sections, there is no mention of any liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, Bilirubin, INR, Albumin) or liver injury. The report focuses solely on dermatological manifestations and outcomes. Therefore, all lab_results fields must be set to null, and the clinical outcome is 'Improved/Discharged' as the patient showed significant improvement and was discharged in stable condition.",
