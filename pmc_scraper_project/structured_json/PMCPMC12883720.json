On day +23 post-transplantation, liver enzymes were elevated with ALT up to 2175 U/L and direct bilirubin up to 60 μmol/L, suspected as drug-induced liver injury from voriconazole. The liver function improved after discontinuation of voriconazole and supportive care. The patient achieved neutrophil engraftment, platelet engraftment, and was discharged in stable condition, indicating an improved outcome. Other liver function indicators such as AST, ALP, GGT, INR, and Albumin were not mentioned in the text.",
