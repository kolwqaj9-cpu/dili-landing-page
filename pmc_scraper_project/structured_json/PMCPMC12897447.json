Initial liver function tests in the ED showed AST 45 U/L and ALT 24 U/L within normal limits. After cefepime initiation, liver enzymes worsened, with peak values mentioned in the discussion: ALT 257 U/L and ALP 114 U/L (R value 2.2). The text also mentions hyperbilirubinemia of 1.8 mg/dL in the ED, but it's unclear if this is the peak. Other lab values like GGT, INR, and Albumin are not specified. The clinical outcome is death from acute hypoxic respiratory failure, though liver injury improved after cefepime cessation.",
