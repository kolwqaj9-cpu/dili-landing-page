Although it was first recognized nearly a century ago, its etiology is still under investigation. Numerous previous studies have widely suggested that neutrophils play a central role in its pathogenesis. This granulomatous necrotizing inflammation has historically been recognized to commonly affect the ear, nose, throat, lungs, and kidneys; however, other organ involvement, including hepatic involvement, has also been occasionally observed. Some older retrospective case studies have reported fatal outcomes associated with liver involvement due to GPA, highlighting the diagnostic challenges it presents. Hence, we present a case report describing a middle-aged gentleman who presented with persistent constitutional symptoms and continuously deranged liver function tests (LFTs) and was ultimately diagnosed with GPA with hepatic involvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>anca pr3 antibodies</kwd><kwd>granulomatosis with polyangiitis (gpa)</kwd><kwd>hepatic involvement</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis of gpa</kwd><kwd>wegenner's granulomatosis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly small to medium vessels (e.g., capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries, and veins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF1">1</xref>].</p><p>In 1931, Heinz Klinger, a German medical student, first highlighted the disease as a borderline form of polyarteritis nodosa. This was noted on one of Friedrich Wegener’s publications whilst describing the similar findings on his case studies, and he determined the disease to be a separate entity. Later, in 1954, Godman and Churg established criteria for the diagnosis and termed the disease “Wegener’s granulomatosis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF4">4</xref>]. In 2011, the eponym was switched to a more disease-descriptive name, "granulomatous with polyangiitis" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF5">5</xref>].</p><p>GPA is a rare autoimmune disease that has a global incidence of 9.0 per million person-years and a prevalence of 96.8 per million person-years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF7">7</xref>].

There was no history of known cardiac arrhythmia or thyroid disease. On taking a more detailed history, the patient had a two-month history of generalized fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg. He also reported a fever of 39°C at home. Additionally, he experienced left ear tenderness for four weeks, a sensation of fullness in the right ear, sinus pain, nasal crusting, and bloody, purulent nasal discharge. He had been treated in the community for upper respiratory tract infection and ear infection with two courses of antibiotics two weeks prior. Thorough systemic examinations showed no palpable lymphadenopathy, no rash, and a normal abdomen and chest, and full neurological examinations were normal.</p><p>Initial blood investigations on admission demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white cell count, along with deranged liver function tests and new-onset anemia. Procalcitonin was within normal limits. Further investigations to rule out infectious causes were performed with three sets of blood cultures, which showed no growth, and viral polymerase chain reaction tests did not detect any pathogens on throat swabs. Sputum samples were also sent, which were negative for acid-fast bacilli and showed no growth of any pathogen on culture. Renal function tests remained within normal limits. The anemia was normocytic and was further evaluated; iron studies and thyroid function tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone) were normal.</p><p>Initial attempts to manage the patient’s symptoms with intravenous fluids, empirical antibiotics, and antipyretics did show no improvement in either the patient’s symptoms or laboratory parameters (liver function test (LFT), anemia, and raised inflammatory markers). Bisoprolol was also commenced in an attempt to manage his persistent sinus tachycardia, which showed minimal improvement, prompting further investigations. A chest X-ray was conducted, which demonstrated bilateral bulky hila along with small nodules in the left mid-zone, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>, raising an initial suspicion of sarcoidosis. On further investigation, his serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were within the normal range, as were serum calcium and 24-hour urinary calcium. A high-resolution CT was subsequently performed, which showed bilateral peribronchovascular and subpleural nodules, as well as bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG2">2</xref>.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="FIG1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Frontal chest X-ray shows bilateral bulky hila along with small nodular opacities in the left mid zones (yellow arrows), suggesting lymphadenopathy and pulmonary involvement. </title></caption><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000100357-i01.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="FIG2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Axial high-resolution CT shows bilateral peribronchovascular nodules (green arrows) and symmetrical bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (yellow arrows).

Hemoglobin dropped from 110 to 93 g/L, accompanied by thrombocytosis and neutrophilia (neutrophils 11.15). Eosinophil levels remained within normal limits. There was no history of alcohol use, and he was not on any regular hepatotoxic or cholestatic medications to consider drug-induced liver injury. He did not have heart failure, to suggest congestive hepatopathy or hypotension to suggest ischemic hepatitis. Further studies to explore the cause for worsening transaminitis were done, including infective liver screening (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV), which was negative. The fluorescent anti-tissue antibody screen (antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, liver kidney microsomal antibody LKM-1, anti-microsomal antibody, and soluble liver antigen) was also negative. Meanwhile, further imaging evaluations were conducted to investigate other potential causes of the deranged liver function. An abdominal ultrasound was reported as normal liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a normal biliary tree. Colonoscopy was also performed to explore the cause behind patients' clinical presentations, which did not reveal any lower gastrointestinal pathology. As part of the diagnostic evaluation, vasculitic screening was performed, which revealed a positive c-ANCA with PR3 levels of 107 IU/mL, raising high suspicion of vasculitic presentation.</p><p>The patient's biochemical laboratory results are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TAB1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="TAB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Biochemical laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and C-reactive protein with high PR3 levels, consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. </title><p>ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Blood Test</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Value</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Unit</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reference Range</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hemoglobin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">93</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">g/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">131-166</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">White cell count</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">x10^9/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.5-9.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Platelets</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">658</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">x10^9/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">150-400</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Neutrophils</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17.87</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">x10^9/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.7-6.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lymphocytes/Monocytes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.58</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">x10^9/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.0-3.0</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Eosinophils</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.07</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">x10^9/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.04-0.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Urea</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6.6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">mmol/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.5-7.8</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Creatinine</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">umol/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">62-106</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">C-reactive protein</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">158</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">mg/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.0-5.0</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Anti-proteinase 3 ELISA test</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">107</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">IU/mL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.0-3.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Anti-myeloperoxidase ELISA Test</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">IU/L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.0-5.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>After multidisciplinary discussions involving rheumatology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory teams, a diagnosis of GPA was made according to the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF11">11</xref>].

However, it has been suggested that the disease may originate from multifactorial (example: infectious, environmental, chemical, toxic, or pharmacological) triggers in genetically susceptible individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF12">12</xref>]. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the primary class of ANCA autoantibodies, which are directed against glycoprotein enzymes found in the granules of neutrophils and the lysosomes of monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF13">13</xref>].</p><p>Proteinase 3 (PR3), the proteolytic enzyme found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, is the primary antigen recognized by ANCA in GPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF15">15</xref>]. ANCA are able to activate primed neutrophils, causing the release of oxygen radicals, lytic enzymes, and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8), leading to endothelial adhesion and cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF14">14</xref>]. PR3-ANCA can interfere with its physiologic inhibitor, alpha 1 antitrypsin, allowing it to remain activated, thus perpetuating inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF15">15</xref>]. Therefore, neutrophils have a key role in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, as they are the target of autoimmunity and are effector cells responsible for endothelial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although GPA is a multisystem disorder that can involve any organ, it classically presents with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations involving the upper airway (ear, nose, and throat), lung and kidney, and constitutional symptoms may precede weeks or months prior to organ involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF16">16</xref>]. The diagnosis of GPA is confirmed based on a combination of serological tests and imaging studies in correlation with the clinical picture, and a biopsy can aid in making a diagnosis, as a single definitive diagnostic test for GPA is yet to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF16">16</xref>].</p><p>The liver is one of the large organs of the body with multiple crucial functions, from manufacturing different enzymes and proteins and metabolising cholesterol, hormones, etc., to detoxifying drugs and toxins and allowing maintenance of homeostasis in the body. Although deranged liver function warrants investigations to rule out alcohol or drug associations and infections, it is vital to consider possible rheumatic/autoimmune disorders, which may present as its primary manifestations. Hepatic involvement in GPA is rarely explained in older studies, whereas a recent study mentions liver involvement in GPA to be 5%-11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF19">19</xref>]. Although more recent studies have been published about it, liver involvement in GPA still remains an infrequent presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF19">19</xref>]. It may present as mild transaminitis or a cholestatic picture to liver cirrhosis or even a fatal complication as a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF20">20</xref>]. Autoimmune hepatitis may also present with negative antinuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, or anti-LKM-1 antibodies and can have positive ANCA; however, it usually presents with positive perinuclear antibodies, whereas this case demonstrates positive cANCA, making it more diagnostic of GPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF20">20</xref>]. True hepatic vasculitis confirmed by biopsy is exceptional, and diagnosis is often made through serology and clinical findings without liver biopsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="REF17">17</xref>]. Hence, awareness of this rare involvement is important for comprehensive patient care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>GPA remains a diagnostic challenge due to its often-vague clinical presentation and the absence of definitive diagnostic criteria, despite the availability of established classification criteria. Although hepatic manifestations are rare, it underscores that clinicians should be vigilant and remain aware of hepatic vasculitis when patients present with systemic symptoms with unexplained elevated liver enzymes, specifically when there are initial diagnostic dilemmas. It is also essential to exclude other potential causes like infections, alcohol- and drug-associated liver injury, and autoimmune hepatic diseases. Nonetheless, this case illustrates that early diagnosis and timely initiation of appropriate therapy are key to improving patient outcomes.
