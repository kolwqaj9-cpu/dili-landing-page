These monoclonal antibodies enhance antitumor immunity by targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, overactivation of the immune system can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in almost all organs, including the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ICI-induced immune-mediated hepatotoxicity (IMH) is a common irAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and can lead to fatal outcomes; therefore, early detection and appropriate management of IMH are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Several guidelines and consensus statements consider corticosteroids as first-line agents for IMH, but some patients do not respond well to it or relapse during corticosteroid tapering. Response to corticosteroids was reported to be less likely in cases of IMH with cholestatic or mixed pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but the clinicopathologic features of steroid-refractory IMH remain unclear. Early identification of steroid-refractory IMH is crucial to avoid the adverse events of prolonged use of ineffective immunosuppressants, shorten the treatment period for IMH, and hasten the resumption of anticancer therapy. Various immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus (TAC), cyclosporine A (CsA), azathioprine (AZA), and antithymocyte globulin, have been tried for steroid-refractory IMH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The guidelines in some countries, including Japan, state that the concomitant use of MMF at 1 g twice daily or other immunosuppressive agents should be considered if liver function tests do not improve or deteriorate further for more than 3–5 days after corticosteroid administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of MMF for steroid-refractory IMH have not been fully evaluated.

With the increasing number of malignancy cases that have gained the clinical benefits of ICIs, the number of irAEs has also increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The liver is one of the organs that are often affected by cancer immunotherapy, and IMH has been reported to be the third most frequent irAE (5% to 10%), after skin toxicity (44% to 68%) and gastrointestinal adverse reactions (35% to 50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Most cases of IMH are relatively mild, but some cases can progress to acute liver failure and fatal outcomes if not properly managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">A cholestatic or mixed pattern of IMH was reported to be more common than the hepatocellular pattern in steroid-refractory cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; however, the absence of significant findings in the present study can be explained by several possible reasons. First, all the IMH cases in this study were pathologically diagnosed by liver biopsy, whereas the previous study did not require liver biopsy for diagnosis and might have included cases of liver injury from other causes. Second, the mean ALT level among the cases with hepatocellular damage was higher in this study than in the previous study [704 IU/L (range: 297–1349 IU/L) vs. 243 IU/L (range: 144–462 IU/L)], probably because more patients in our cohort were treated with PD-L1 + CTLA-4 (34.8% vs. 12.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The similar interval from IMH onset to PSL initiation between the MMF responder and MMF non-responder groups implied that PSL was administered early after IMH onset. To our best knowledge, the correlation between the pathological features of IMH and steroid resistance has not been reported. This study was the first to demonstrate that cholangitis was more prominent in steroid-refractory IMH than in steroid-responsive IMH; this finding might be consistent with the report that steroid-refractory IMH commonly presents as a cholestatic or mixed pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">MMF inhibits inosinate dehydrogenase in the purine biosynthetic pathway and inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on the expected improvement of IMH by inhibiting T and B cell activation, MMF was recommended by the Japanese guideline for steroid-refractory IMH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, MMF is not covered by the national health insurance in Japan because of insufficient evidence of effectiveness for IMH. In our cohort, although one patient was refractory to MMF treatment and needed TAC, the remaining majority of steroid-refractory IMH cases achieved remission with MMF treatment without any adverse event. Because our cohort was larger than that of previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">We defined MMF responders as patients whose rate of decline in ALT levels increased at one week after MMF initiation, compared with that at 1 week before MMF initiation. However, all patients, except one who was treated with PSL + MMF, eventually improved indicating that MMF addition was mostly effective for PSL refractory cases, including MMF non-responders. The duration of MMF administration was significantly longer in MMF non-responders than responders (51 days vs. 20 days shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>), implying that the ALT decline rate might be lower in MMF non-responders than responders. Given the histological cholangitis highly indicates PSL refractoriness, we suggested that earlier MMF initiation for the cases with cholangitis might be beneficial. The result that the interval from PSL initiation to MMF initiation was significantly longer in the MMF non-responder group than in the MMF responder group would support our suggestion of earlier MMF initiation.</p><p id="Par44">Although the positive rate of histological cholangitis was similar between MMF responders and non-responders (71.4% vs. 66.7%, respectively) in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>, the rate with cholestatic and mixed pattern was significantly higher in the MMF non-responder group than in the MMF responder group (100% vs. 28.6%, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). These findings indicated that histological cholangitis is not directly linked to cholestatic or mixed pattern. It is possible that immunosuppressants other than MMF could be more effective for MMF non-responders with cholestatic or mixed pattern. As our cohort is too small for elucidating this clinical question, a clinical study on a larger cohort of IMH is needed.</p><p id="Par45">There were several limitations in this study. First, this study had a single-center and retrospective design, and the treatment for IMH was not entirely consistent, because it depended on the discretion of the attending physician. Second, the number of patients included in this study was small, although it was larger than that in previous studies. Further research on a larger cohort is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par46">Compared with steroid-responsive IMH, steroid-refractory IMH had longer treatment duration and more frequent findings of cholangitis on histology. MMF is a safe and effective second-line drug for steroid-refractory IMH and should be considered to administer early to patients with histological cholangitis on liver biopsy. As MMF might be less effective in cases of IMH with cholestatic or mixed pattern, further clinical study with a larger cohort is needed to determine which immunosuppressant would be better for those IMH patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
