For decades, off-label drugs and/or drugs with little evidence of efficacy have been used to treat pruritus or as supportive therapy. In recent years, a family of molecules known as bile acid transporter inhibitors (IBATis) has been developed, with two of these being approved for treating pruritus in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and Alagille syndrome (ALGS). Blocking the ileal reabsorption of bile acids (BAs) lowers serum levels. This contributes to reducing cholestatic pruritus. Such a mechanism of action may also have a potential benefit in other cholestatic diseases and even in the consequences of chronic cholestasis. This is a narrative review of the literature, including the most recent communications, to summarize data on the efficacy and safety of IBATis in the treatment of pruritus in PFIC and ALGS in children, including a description of the latest results from their use in a real-world setting. Reports on off-label use and experiences in adults are also discussed. This review aims to help physicians understand the potential and limitations of these new drugs in the treatment of cholestatic pruritus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric cholestasis diseases</kwd><kwd>PFIC</kwd><kwd>Alagille syndrome</kwd><kwd>cholestatic pruritus</kwd><kwd>IBAT inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-pediatrrep-18-00019" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction and Aims</title><p>Hundreds of proteins contribute to the biosynthesis and excretion of bile components from hepatocytes to the biliary tree. Mutations in each of the genes encoding these proteins may be the cause of an inherited monogenic disease. In addition, a heterogeneous group of acquired cholestatic disorders exist, including biliary atresia, which is the most prevalent cholestatic disease in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-pediatrrep-18-00019">1</xref>].</p><p>Although rare individually, taken together, cholestatic diseases represent the commonest indication for liver transplantation (LT) in any age group, accounting for between 50 and 60% of all pediatric liver transplants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-pediatrrep-18-00019">2</xref>]. Each year, approximately 300 children in Europe and the United States undergo LT for cholestatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-pediatrrep-18-00019">3</xref>].</p><p>A real cure is exceptionally available, such as cholic acid in bile acid synthesis defects. The prognosis of the majority of diseases depends essentially on the severity of the phenotype. Most affected children will require a liver transplant at some point.</p><p>Cholestasis has several clinical consequences, including malabsorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins, retention of bile components in the blood and progressive liver damage secondary to cell death and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-pediatrrep-18-00019">4</xref>]. Itching may be the most disabling symptom of cholestasis. The cause of pruritus is not fully understood. Several molecules probably play a role. Among them, bile acids are the most known. In most cases, the serum concentration of BA reflects the severity of itching, albeit imperfectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-pediatrrep-18-00019">5</xref>].</p><p>Occasionally intractable itching is the main indication for transplantation, even in the presence of a liver with sufficient functional reserve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-pediatrrep-18-00019">4</xref>]. Treatment of pruritus, however, has been unsatisfactory so far. Until recently off-label drugs and/or drugs with little evidence of efficacy have been used to treat pruritus. In recent years a new class of drugs, called inhibitors of ileal bile acid transporters, has successfully completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). They are currently approved both in Europe than in the US for the treatment of pruritus in PFIC and ALGS.</p><p>The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the existing evidence on the effectiveness of IBATis in treating cholestatic pruritus in children. We have considered both approved indications and both available molecules to provide a broader overview. Moreover, special attention was paid to real-world data and off-label use in order to better assess the impact of this new class of drugs in daily practice. The main limitation of this work is that recent data from real-world case series are only available in the form of non-peer-reviewed abstracts or in the context of small case series within multicenter observational studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pediatrrep-18-00019" sec-type="methods"><title>2. Methods</title><p>This is a narrative review. However, a structured literature search was carried out using the electronic database PubMed with no time restrictions in October 2025. The search terms used were as follows: (maralixibat) OR (odevixibat) OR volixibat OR (elobixibat) OR (linerixibat). A total of 82 papers were considered, excluding reviews. However, we also decided to extend the research to include abstracts presented at major international conferences, as the most recent real-world study results have not yet been fully published. Additionally, some secondary outcomes from registration studies were made public after the main results were published and are currently only available in abstract form. For this reason, we reviewed the proceedings from the annual meetings of the AASLD, EASL and ESPGHAN over the last three years (2023–2025).</p><p>We only considered abstracts that report on the sub-analysis results of registration studies or results from open-label extension studies or issued from collaborations within national scientific societies. However, it should be noted that these data have not been peer-reviewed and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Citations that refer to congress proceedings are clearly marked in both the main text and the references section.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-pediatrrep-18-00019"><title>3. Cholestatic Diseases of Infancy and Childhood</title><p>A number of liver diseases may present with cholestatic features. Here, we summarize only the most relevant with regard to experience with IBATis.</p><p><bold>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</bold> is a group of monogenic diseases with a marked cholestatic phenotype characterized by a defect in a protein involved in the process of bile formation and excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-pediatrrep-18-00019">6</xref>]. A total of 13 variants have been recognized so far (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t001">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-pediatrrep-18-00019">7</xref>].</p><p><bold>PFIC1</bold> is defined by a defect in the familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) protein, encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">ATPB1</italic> gene. FIC1 is an aminophospholipid flippase that creates an imbalance in the distribution of membrane phospholipids by translocating phosphatidylserine to the inner side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-pediatrrep-18-00019">8</xref>]. This imbalance is probably necessary for the functioning of several membrane pumps including the bile salt export pump (BSEP) or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). FIC1 expression is ubiquitous; affected patients have intrahepatic cholestasis and pruritus but usually also extrahepatic manifestations such as failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea and malabsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-pediatrrep-18-00019">8</xref>].</p><p>BSEP defect characterizes <bold>PFIC2</bold>. This protein is the main transporter of BA in bile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The bile of affected children has a very low or absent BA concentration while hepatocytes suffer severe and early damage due to the high intracellular concentration. It is an exclusively hepatic disease characterized by severe itching, high alpha-fetoprotein values and a pronounced tendency to carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-pediatrrep-18-00019">9</xref>].</p><p><bold>PFIC3</bold> is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">ABCB4</italic> gene, which encodes the multidrug resistance 3 (MDR3) protein. MDR3 is a floppase that enriches the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane with phosphatidylcholine, enabling the extraction and incorporation of phosphatidylcholine into the biliary mixed micelles. Bile phospholipids are essential to prevent injury to biliary epithelia caused by hydrophobic BA. Patients produce toxic, very low phospholipids containing bile and typically have high GGT activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-pediatrrep-18-00019">10</xref>]. PFIC3 patients may also present in late childhood with chronic cholangitis and advanced fibrosis, mild itching and signs of portal hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-pediatrrep-18-00019">11</xref>].</p><p><bold>PFIC4</bold> is caused by the malfunction of tight junction protein 2 (TJP2). Nonfunctional tight junctions allow the reflux of BA and other components of bile in the paracellular compartment, ultimately causing damage and fibrosis. Severity of disease is highly variable, and symptoms include jaundice, hepatomegaly, itching, usually low GGT and elevated serum bile acids (sBAs) at laboratory assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-pediatrrep-18-00019">12</xref>]. The mechanisms of cholestasis are very different from PFIC 1-2-3 and are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>B.</p><p><bold>PFIC10</bold> is caused by defective intracellular trafficking, due to mutated myosin-Vb protein (MYO5B), resulting in incorrect positioning of canalicular transporters, including BSEP. Pathogenesis of cholestasis is similar to PFIC 2 with a very low biliary concentration of BA. Symptoms include jaundice and severe itching, but extrahepatic features are common such as failure to thrive and diarrhea. The same gene is causative of microvillous inclusion disease (MVID) with a complex genotype–phenotype correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-pediatrrep-18-00019">13</xref>].</p><p><bold>Alagille syndrome (ALGS)</bold> is an inherited, multiorgan disease caused in over 90% of cases by mutations of the <italic toggle="yes">JAG1</italic> gene or in 2–3% of cases by mutations in <italic toggle="yes">NOTCH2</italic>. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease but up to 60% of mutations are de novo. The Notch signaling pathway is critical for cell-to-cell communication during embryogenesis. Jagged 1 is one of the ligands of the four Notch receptors, and its correct expression in the liver is critical for the development of a normal intrahepatic biliary tree. Other affected organs include the heart and vascular system, kidney, bones and eyes, and patients have typical facial features. The hepatic phenotype of ALGS is most commonly neonatal cholestasis with high GGT. Pruritus is usually severe in early childhood, while older children tend to show signs of portal hypertension, though cholestasis is milder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-pediatrrep-18-00019">14</xref>]. In ALGS, the pathogenesis of cholestasis is essentially obstructive, and interlobular biliary ducts are often absent or dysmorphic.</p><p><bold>Biliary atresia</bold> is the most common cholestatic disease affecting 30–40% of cholestatic newborns. Early and progressive fibrosis and obliteration of both intra- and extrahepatic biliary ducts cause severe and irreversible cholestasis. It is an acquired disease; children in most cases are born healthy. This is the prototype of obstructive cholestasis; untreated children quickly develop terminal biliary cirrhosis and usually die by the age of two. Early Kasai portoenterostomy can restore a certain amount of biliary flow, but ultimately most children will need a liver transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-pediatrrep-18-00019">15</xref>]. Itching is usually present in small children with decompensated cirrhosis waiting for liver transplant or in older children with bile flow only partially restored.</p><p><bold>Sclerosing cholangitis</bold> in children is in most cases an acquired, autoimmune disease. Patients are typically young adolescents, and most of them suffer also from inflammatory bowel disease. Cholestasis occurs in advanced stages of the disease when fibrosclerosis of the bile ducts causes mechanical stenosis. However, retention of BA may contribute to the scarring process by promoting periductal fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-pediatrrep-18-00019">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pediatrrep-18-00019"><title>4. IBAT Inhibitors</title><p>After hepatic synthesis and intestinal excretion mainly through BSEP, BAs are actively reabsorbed into the final ileal loop by IBAT, a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family, encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">SLC10A2</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-pediatrrep-18-00019">17</xref>]. IBAT functions as a membrane-bound transporter that actively co-transports conjugated BAs using the drive of sodium gradients into enterocytes. From there, BAs cross the basolateral membrane via organic solute transporters (OST) α and β and reach the liver with the portal blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) closes the enterohepatic cycle by uptaking BAs again into hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-pediatrrep-18-00019">18</xref>]. Intestinal reabsorption guarantees over 95% efficiency with only 5% of BAs being lost with stools. IBAT is mainly expressed on the apical membrane of enterocytes in the terminal ileum, but it can also be found at lower levels in the kidneys, where it hypothetically prevents loss of BAs in urine, and in cholangiocytes to form a smaller cholangio-hepatic loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-pediatrrep-18-00019">19</xref>].</p><p>IBATis are small molecules not absorbed into systemic circulation that bind IBAT in the distal ileum, preventing reabsorption and causing massive fecal loss of BAs. Historically, this class of drugs was developed as cholesterol-lowering agents, as the loss of BAs activates hepatic production via the farnesoid X receptor and consequently the consumption of cholesterol as a precursor of the BA synthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-pediatrrep-18-00019">20</xref>].</p><p>The availability of more effective drugs with less side effects for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia led to the evaluation of IBATis as a cure for cholestatic diseases, cholestatic pruritus and even constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-pediatrrep-18-00019">21</xref>]. Indeed, the major side effect of IBATis is the softening of stools or mild diarrhea due to increased motility secondary to the massive passing of BA in the colon. This effect, however, is generally transient.</p><p>To date, five molecules have been developed but only two of them have been studied in children. Odevixibat was the first to complete registration trials for PFIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-pediatrrep-18-00019">22</xref>] while maralixibat first completed trials for ALGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-pediatrrep-18-00019">23</xref>]. However, they have been licensed in the US and Europe for both diseases now. It is worth noting that in mouse models the reduction in BA concentration was greatest in the blood compartment, but a 65% reduction was also observed intrahepatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-pediatrrep-18-00019">24</xref>]. Improvement of inflammation and fibrosis was also observed, likely due to the reduction in BA-mediated injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-pediatrrep-18-00019">25</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the efficacy of IBATis is critically dependent on the ability of BAs to be transported in the intestine and consequently lost. Indeed, the effect of reducing blood concentrations is maximal in healthy subjects and virtually nil in severe obstructive cholestasis. This limitation has significant implications for the treatment of genetic cholestasis in children.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-pediatrrep-18-00019"><title>5. Progressive Familiar Intrahepatic Cholestasis</title><sec id="sec5dot1-pediatrrep-18-00019"><title>5.1. Natural History</title><p>Over the last decade, knowledge on PFIC has grown thanks to the NAPPED (Natural Course and Prognosis of PFIC and Effect of Biliary Diversion) consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-pediatrrep-18-00019">26</xref>]. The NAPPED registry collected the retrospective data of more than 800 patients, mainly with PFIC1 and PFIC2, from &gt;70 centers from all continents. Despite the heterogenicity of the data, a few major issues such as natural history, genotype–phenotype correlation and response to surgical biliary diversion (SBD) have been addressed.</p><p>PFIC1 patients showed a native liver survival (NLS) of 70%, 59% and 44% at, respectively, 5, 10 and 18 years of age. SBD was commonly performed in these patients; 62 out of 130 patients (48%) underwent SBD at a median age of 5,9 years, and 15 of them (24%) later received liver transplantation (LT) with a median time from SBD of 2,5 years. The benefit of SBD has only been suggested for a minority of patients who respond with a marked decrease in sBA. The NLS cumulative curve was similar between children who did or did not receive an SBD, but the cut-off of 65 μmol/L for sBA after SBD was able to identify a subgroup of patients with better outcome. A sustained relief of pruritus, however, was noted only in a fraction of those patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-pediatrrep-18-00019">27</xref>].</p><p>As regards biomarkers of severity, only degree of cholestasis at disease onset, as reflected by sBA and serum total bilirubin (TB) concentrations under the cut-off value of 191 μmol/L and 72 μmol/L, respectively, was associated with better long-term NLS.</p><p>Indeed, no genotype–phenotype correlation was found. The presence of one or even two truncating mutations was not associated with a worse NLS or SBD outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-pediatrrep-18-00019">27</xref>].</p><p>A larger cohort of 264 patients with PFIC2 was studied within the NAPPED consortium.</p><p>PFIC2 was confirmed to be a severe disease, 16 patients died during a median follow-up time of 4,1 years and only 32% of them were alive with their native liver at the age of 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-pediatrrep-18-00019">28</xref>].</p><p>Severity of disease was easily predictable according to genotype. NLS at 18 years was 55% in patients with at least one of the two milder known missense mutations, p.E297G or p.D482G, less than 30% in patients with at least another missense mutation and virtually none of patients with two truncating mutations survived with their native liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-pediatrrep-18-00019">28</xref>]. A recent analysis found that the most negative prognostic factor is the presence of even a single truncating mutation, regardless of the second mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-pediatrrep-18-00019">29</xref>]. Once more, sBAs have been identified as predictors of outcome after SBD. A decrease of at least 75% in sBAs or a level &lt;102 μmol/L after SBD was associated with improved NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-pediatrrep-18-00019">28</xref>]. These findings influenced the design of registration trials of IBATis as discussed below.</p><p>PFIC3 is the most common high-GGT variant. A wide spectrum of phenotypes in children and adults is linked to <italic toggle="yes">ABCB4</italic> deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-pediatrrep-18-00019">10</xref>]; pediatric onset diseases are those characterized by more severe genotypes, usually biallelic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-pediatrrep-18-00019">30</xref>]. The clinical picture is characterized by high-GGT cholestasis with progressive fibrosis and portal hypertension. Histology reveals ductular cholestasis, inflammatory cholangitis and various degrees of fibrosis. PFIC3 is a severe disease, the NAPPED consortium has not yet collected enough cases to determine the natural course of the disease. However a long-term follow-up of a historical case series from the Bicêtre group in France has recently been published. In total, 71% of patients had cirrhosis at a median age of 8.1 years, and 66% of these patients received a liver transplant at a median age of 8.5 years. NLS strictly correlated with severity of genotype. Patients with two truncating mutations were all transplanted before 10 years of age, while over 60% of patients carrying at least one missense mutation were alive with native liver at 20 years of age, albeit with varying degrees of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-pediatrrep-18-00019">31</xref>].</p><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has shown some efficacy as a treatment for PFIC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-pediatrrep-18-00019">32</xref>]. It produces a more hydrophilic pool of BAs, which reduces the detergent and toxic power of the phospholipid-poor bile of these patients. Patients who have mutations resulting in a higher functional residue of MDR3 are more prone to respond to UDCA, and biliary phospholipid levels above 6.9% predicted response to UDCA therapy.

Registrational Trials of IBATis in PFIC</title><p>The pharmacologic strategy of IBAT inhibition with odevixibat to reduce sBAs and cholestatic pruritus was tested in a phase 1 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-pediatrrep-18-00019">33</xref>] and then validated in a phase 2 study conducted in Northern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-pediatrrep-18-00019">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t002">Table 2</xref>). In this open-label trial, 20 patients with chronic cholestasis were treated with different doses of odevixibat (10–200 mcg/kg). Interestingly, in addition to 11 patients with PFIC, 6 patients with ALGS and 3 with biliary atresia were also enrolled. The PFIC patients were as follows: one with PFIC1, seven with PFIC2, two with PFIC3 and one patient with PFIC10. Changes in sBA from baseline were the primary efficacy endpoint. Mean change after 4 weeks of treatment was −165.1 mmol/L (range, 394 to 1.2) in patients with PFIC. All patients showed a reduction in sBA, except one patient who carried an intronic splice site mutation in <italic toggle="yes">ABCB11</italic> with complete absence of the BSEP protein.

At week 24, 33% of treated patients achieved sBA endpoint vs. none in the placebo group, and 55% of treated patients vs. 30% in the placebo group reached the pruritus endpoint.

PEDFIC-1 continued as PEDFIC-2, a 72-week extension, open-label study with all patients receiving 120 mcg/kg. The results were published in 2023 considering a data cut-off of 24 weeks in PEDFIC-2 with up to 48 weeks of cumulative odevixibat exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-pediatrrep-18-00019">37</xref>]. Interestingly, sBA responders, based on the criteria of PEDFIC-1, increased from 33% at week 24 to 53% at week 48, suggesting that in some cases six months of treatment are not enough to measure final efficacy. Moreover, 61% of patients enrolled directly in PEDFIC-2 achieved the pruritus endpoint after 24 weeks of treatment. The presence of patients with PFIC other than type 1-2 probably influenced this result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-pediatrrep-18-00019">37</xref>].</p><p>Stratified, long-term results were recently presented at international meetings. At the end of PEDFIC-2, a total of 36 patients with PFIC1 were treated: 2 patients interrupted treatment and 14 were pruritus responders (39%), but only 5 (14%) fulfilled the sBA reduction outcome. Response was sustained after up to 96 weeks of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-pediatrrep-18-00019">38</xref>] (abs). As for PFIC2, 26 out of 69 patients were sBA responders (37%) at week 24. sBA response was largely concordant with pruritus response. sBA responders had early and sustained reductions both in sBA and in pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-pediatrrep-18-00019">39</xref>] (abs). As regards safety, odevixibat was generally well tolerated, as expected for an unadsorbed molecule, and drug-related adverse events occurred in 29% of patients, all mild or moderate, with none of them leading to discontinuation of therapy. The most common were increased ALT (5.7%) and bilirubin (10%).

It was an open-label, phase 2, long-term study that enrolled 33 patients, 8 PFIC1 and 25 PFIC2. Six PFIC2 patients carried biallelic, protein truncating mutations and 19 had at least 1 non-truncating mutation. Patients received maralixibat 266 μg/kg until week 72 and then eventually increased to 266 μg/kg twice daily. Long-term efficacy was assessed at week 240.

The MARCH-PFIC study enrolled 93 patients in three cohorts: patients with biallelic, non-truncated BSEP deficiency, patients with PFIC other than PFIC2 and a placebo. The dose was 570 mcg/kg/die, and treatment duration was 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was the mean change in pruritus severity score, and the key secondary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in total serum bile acids. The mean decrease from baseline in the pruritus score was 1.8 points in treated patients vs. 0.6 in the placebo group, and the mean change in sBA was −160 μmol/L vs. an increase of +3 μmol/L in the placebo group. Globally, 63,6% of patients met the pruritus endpoint criteria vs. 25,8% in the placebo cohort, and 54% vs. 6,5% met the sBA endpoint. Patients with non-BSEP PFIC showed a better response in terms of pruritus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-pediatrrep-18-00019">44</xref>]. Preliminary, non-peer-reviewed data from the MARCH-ON study, a single-arm extension protocol that was also comprised of patients from the MARCH-PFIC, showed that patients with PFIC1-2 who achieved the sBA endpoint showed a better 2-year outcome than those with an insufficient reduction in sBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-pediatrrep-18-00019">45</xref>] (abs).

Real-World Experience</title><p>Clinical trials are generally conducted in a very selected population, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. This type of study does not always reflect the complexity of different clinical situations, especially in rare diseases. Real-world studies are observational studies conducted after drugs are commercially available. They are a precious and selection-unbiased tool to assess the efficacy of new drugs under day-by-day conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t001">Table 1</xref>). The Expanded Access Program launched in Italy in 2021 allowed clinicians to treat PFIC patients with odevixibat including children who could not be enrolled in trials. A total of 24 patients have been treated, including rarer forms of PFIC: 5 PFIC4, 1 PFIC5, 1 PFIC10 and 1 PFIC9. Baseline data depicted a quite cholestatic population with pretreatment sBAs of 317 μmol/L, severe pruritus in most patients and signs of portal hypertension in seven of them. Using PEDFIC-1 criteria, reduction in sBA was remarkably higher than in PEDFIC1-2: responders were 54% at 3 months and 75% at 6 months. Similarly, pruritus responders at 6 months were as much as 73%. Stratifying patients per PFIC types, patients with PFIC1-2 showed a lower response rate, 63% at 6 months for sBA, but still outperformed PEDFIC1-2. Six patients did not respond, five of which had PFIC2, including two patients with truncated protein and one with PFIC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48-pediatrrep-18-00019">48</xref>].

In particular, TJP2 deficiency (PFIC4) appears to be the PFIC variant that respond better to IBATis. In a subgroup of PFIC4 patients, improvement of pruritus was terrific, from very severe to none in one case, and all patients showed a reduction in sBA ≥ 70% from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50-pediatrrep-18-00019">50</xref>]. These results are consistent with the mechanism of disease in PFIC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In these patients, the functionality of membrane transporters was intact, and cholestasis results from reflux of bile through defective tight junctions. A great proportion of BAs can reach the ileus and be lost in stools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Also, in PFIC10, odevixibat seems very effective.

Alagille Syndrome</title><sec id="sec6dot1-pediatrrep-18-00019"><title>6.1. Natural History</title><p>ALGS is a systemic disease. There is significant long-term mortality, more often due to extrahepatic disease. NLS was estimated in historical cohorts between 50 and 65% at age of 10 years and 25–60% at the age of 20. Among patients who died with their native liver, liver-related disease was the cause in only one-third of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-pediatrrep-18-00019">57</xref>]. The most frequent causes of death are cardiac or vascular/hemorrhagic episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58-pediatrrep-18-00019">58</xref>]. Cardiovascular phenotype is the most important determinant of outcome. Patients with structural heart disease suffered from up to 60% mortality before 10 years of age in the largest series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59-pediatrrep-18-00019">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60-pediatrrep-18-00019">60</xref>]. Liver disease, however, is the primary cause of morbidity due to chronic courses and a frequent need for LT. A cholestatic picture characterizes the first years of age, and patients with neonatal cholestasis have a faster disease progression and earlier need for transplant. At this stage, jaundice, pruritus, xanthomas and failure to thrive are the most common symptoms. In patients surviving with their native liver, cholestasis decreases with age, and the clinical picture slowly evolves towards signs of portal hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59-pediatrrep-18-00019">59</xref>]. A threshold for total bilirubin (TB) of 3.8 mg/dL between 12 and 24 months was identified as a risk for poor outcome in a multicentric study in the UK and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61-pediatrrep-18-00019">61</xref>].</p><p>As in the case of PFIC, another international consortium, the Global Alagille Alliance (GALA) Study Group, collected data from more than 1500 patients from 34 countries around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62-pediatrrep-18-00019">62</xref>]. The results refined several existing concepts. Cumulative NLS was consistent with previous studies, but the size of the population allowed early predictors of poor outcome to be better predicted. Bilirubin was the most important, and children &gt; 6 and ≤12 months of age with median TB levels of ≥10.0 mg/dL have an increased risk of LT, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 15.6 and an 8.0-fold HR to develop clinically evident portal hypertension versus patients with TB &lt; 5.0 mg/dL.</p><p>Overall, 72% of transplants were performed before 5 years of age. The most common indication (70%) was cholestasis and pruritus at a median age of 2.5 years. The remaining 30% of transplants were performed for decompensated portal hypertension at a median age of 4.2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62-pediatrrep-18-00019">62</xref>].</p><p>In a secondary analysis, not fully published, sBAs were also a prognostic factor for NLS, as expected, and remained significant, adjusting for TB clearance at 1 year.

Published in 2021, it was a placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period (RWD), phase 2b study with open-label extension. After 18 weeks of maralixibat dosed at 380 μg/kg once per day, patients were randomized to continue maralixibat or receive a placebo for 4 weeks and then open-label maralixibat until week 48. Thereafter, during long-term extension, the study doses were increased up to 380 μg/kg twice per day. The primary endpoint was the mean sBA changing after withdrawal in participants with at least 50% sBA reduction by week 18. This complex trial design was specifically designed to minimize the placebo effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64-pediatrrep-18-00019">64</xref>]. In total, 15 out of 29 patients (51.7%) achieved an sBA reduction of at least 50% from baseline to week 18. At the end of the RWD, mean difference in sBA between the maralixibat and placebo groups was −114 µmol/L. During the core 48-week period, in the overall population, 24 (83%) of 29 participants had an sBA reduction of at least 20%. Reduction in sBAs from baseline to week 48 was −96 µmol/L, and pruritus improved significantly with a −1.6 ItchRO(Obs) score. Maralixibat was well tolerated, and most adverse events occurred in the first weeks and were self-limiting.

The average duration of treatment with maralixibat was 4.7 years, and the aim of this analysis was to identify predictors of EFS and NLS. Overall, EFS and NLS at 6 years from the start of maralixibat were 76% and 79%. TB at week 48 was the strongest predictor of EFS with an optimal threshold of 6.5 mg/dL (94% &lt;6.5 mg/dL vs. 42% &gt;6.5 mg/dL). Reductions of &gt;1 point of ItchRO(Obs) pruritus score and sBA &lt; 200 µmol/L at 48 week were also good predictors of EFS.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)</title><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune liver disease of adulthood characterized by the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and, over time, fibrosis and cirrhosis. It primarily affects middle-aged women and often presents with fatigue, pruritus and elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Despite available treatments like ursodeoxycholic acid, many patients continue to experience symptoms—particularly pruritus—that significantly impair quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86-pediatrrep-18-00019">86</xref>]. In 2018, a pilot study investigated the potential role of odevixibat in nine patients with PBC, treated with two different doses (0.75 mg and 1.5 mg) for four weeks, with the option to escalate the dose to 3 mg after one week if tolerated.

Discussion</title><p>It has almost been ten years since the first phase 1 study on odevixibat was published. Since then, more than 800 patients worldwide have been treated with the commercially available drug odevixibat and around 1000 with maralixibat. More importantly, data from real-world observational prospective cohort studies are beginning to become available (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t003">Table 3</xref>). These cohorts are not subject to the limitations of clinical trials, which typically enroll patients according to criteria designed to facilitate the achievement of endpoints. However, it should be noted that multicentric observational studies suffer from a certain heterogeneity in the enrollment criteria, and in particular, the local decision-making process that led to the start of treatment is unknown. In addition, for some of these studies, only non-peer-reviewed communications are currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72-pediatrrep-18-00019">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73-pediatrrep-18-00019">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74-pediatrrep-18-00019">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75-pediatrrep-18-00019">75</xref>] (abs). Nevertheless, we believe that critically assessing and combining these data can provide a realistic overview.</p><p>Pruritus is one of the most disabling symptoms in cholestatic liver disease. Despite years of investigation, its origin remains elusive. A number of potential players such as lysophosphatidic acid, resulting after hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine operated by the enzyme autotaxin, have been studied without definitive conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98-pediatrrep-18-00019">98</xref>].</p><p>BAs are able to activate all pruritogenic receptors but not in physiological conditions, with the only exception being the Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-pediatrrep-18-00019">3</xref>]. Interestingly, serum from patients with a deficit of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), who typically do not suffer from itching, is equally able to activate TGR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-pediatrrep-18-00019">3</xref>]. The direct role of BA in causing pruritus has never been demonstrated. We learned from early IBATis trials that no statistically significant correlations exist between baseline sBA and pruritus, but after treatment the change in SBA and autotaxin levels accurately reflects the change in itching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-pediatrrep-18-00019">34</xref>]. In summary, plasma levels of conjugated bile salts and their secondary derivatives correlate well with pruritus intensity in the single patient, but there is great inter-individual variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-pediatrrep-18-00019">3</xref>].</p><p>IBATis are drugs that ultimately lower the blood concentration of BAs in 40–50% of patients with PFIC or ALGS and at the same time significantly reduce pruritus in 50–60% of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-pediatrrep-18-00019">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-pediatrrep-18-00019">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-pediatrrep-18-00019">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-pediatrrep-18-00019">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64-pediatrrep-18-00019">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70-pediatrrep-18-00019">70</xref>]. Interestingly, both registrational trials and real-world studies have shown that some patients with sBA levels that are still high show a measurable improvement in pruritus, while the contrary is only exceptionally observed. In other words, experience with IBATis has shown that a reduction in sBA strongly correlates with a reduction in itching, but a reduction in pruritus is not always associated with decreased sBA.</p><p>Moreover, experience with surgical enterohepatic circulation interruption in PFIC has shown that the main limitation of IBAT inhibition is that BAs must reach the intestine in order to be eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-pediatrrep-18-00019">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-pediatrrep-18-00019">29</xref>]. The network of proteins responsible for transporting BAs out of the hepatocyte must ensure a residual function that provides a rate of elimination greater than the hepatocyte’s maximum synthetic capacity. Given these conditions, it will only be a matter of time, in some cases even more than six months, before the BA pool is depleted and pruritus might improve.</p><p>It has been proven that patients with BSEP deficiency who carry variants producing nonfunctional/truncated protein do not show any benefits from SBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-pediatrrep-18-00019">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-pediatrrep-18-00019">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99-pediatrrep-18-00019">99</xref>]. Consequently, only patients with at least one missense mutation of BSEP were enrolled in later trials such as the PEDFIC-1 study. A proportion of them, however, were not responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-pediatrrep-18-00019">36</xref>]. Looking for predictors of IBATis response, composition analysis of sBA on a pretreatment serum sample of 41 patients with PFIC2 enrolled in PEDFIC-1 showed that the baseline concentration of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was higher in responders than in non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100-pediatrrep-18-00019">100</xref>]. A higher pretreatment unconjugated sBA concentration in responders is likely due to the passage to the colon of a greater amount of conjugated BA that undergoes deconjugation by colonic microbiota, indirectly confirming that residual BSEP function is the critical prerequisite for treatment response to IBATis. Accordingly, PFIC2 patients with higher pretreatment bilirubin levels were more likely non-responders after IBATis treatment. Similar results were found also after 24 weeks of treatment. The fraction of unconjugated sBAs were more than 70-fold higher, and the absolute concentration was 2-fold higher in responders than in non-responders and the placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97-pediatrrep-18-00019">97</xref>].

Treated patients have higher 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) levels, a surrogate marker of hepatic BA synthesis rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103-pediatrrep-18-00019">103</xref>] (abs). Higher C4 concentrations were found also in PFIC2 responders in the PEDFIC-1 study, but the increase during IBATis therapy, although significant, led to values comparable to healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-pediatrrep-18-00019">36</xref>]. In the INDIGO study, the C4 pretreatment level was higher in patients with truncating BSEP mutation and gradually increased only in responders during treatment with maralixibat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-pediatrrep-18-00019">42</xref>].</p><p>From real-life experience, we observed that a treatment duration up to one year may be necessary to appreciate clinical results and that non-1–2 PFIC shows better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48-pediatrrep-18-00019">48</xref>].</p><p>Almost all patients who experience a clinical benefit show, in the long term, a highly variable decrease in sBA concentration, but the magnitude of this reduction does not parallel the improvement in pruritus often being less pronounced.</p><p>Whether this reduction in sBA will lead to a real change in the long-term natural history of the underlying disease is a much-debated topic. It will probably be necessary to wait many years to obtain the answer.</p><p>Studies that have attempted to compare treated patients with historical cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-pediatrrep-18-00019">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-pediatrrep-18-00019">68</xref>] (abs), using complex statistical methods, are not fully reliable for several reasons. Firstly, the historical cohorts themselves are affected by an intrinsic bias resulting from the extreme heterogeneity of management, particularly with regard to availability and the propensity for transplantation. Secondly, since pruritus is the main indication for transplantation in the early stages of the disease, particularly for ALGS, a significant reduction in the likelihood of transplantation is widely expected, due to the marked efficacy in reducing the symptom and also to the hope that new and even more effective treatments may emerge in the near future. What seems plausible is that patients with milder phenotypes, i.e., those who are less cholestatic, are the best candidates to obtain from BA depletion some kind of benefit in terms of the progression of fibrosis due to chronic cholestasis.</p><p>In terms of safety, it is now well established that IBATis are safe drugs. Diarrhea and abdominal pain cannot be considered true adverse events, but they are consequential and, in fact, directly related to the effectiveness of the IBAT block and the passage of BAs into the colon. Therefore, tolerance of these symptoms will be higher due to the greater relief from itching. This could explain the wide variability in reported frequency and the relatively higher incidence in real-life studies, which more often involved patients with milder phenotypes. The only notable true side effect is the occasional increase in transaminases, which has resulted in a small number of treatment interruptions. While this is usually only temporary, caution is still necessary, as the long-term consequences of this phenomenon are still unknown. Careful monitoring of α-fetoprotein levels appears reasonable. Contrary to expectations, it is clear that there is no real risk of fat-soluble vitamin depletion, given that most patients are already receiving supplementation before treatment onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104-pediatrrep-18-00019">104</xref>] (abs).</p><p>The first guidelines incorporating the use of IBATis in the treatment of cholestatic pruritus have recently been published. They were developed by an EASL working group that included a significant number of pediatricians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105-pediatrrep-18-00019">105</xref>]. For pediatric patients with PFICs or ALGS, IBATis are recommended as a second-line treatment after rifampicin and UDCA have been tried, even though UDCA cannot be considered a drug solely for treating pruritus. On the basis of the data published to date, this position appears reasonable, but some further considerations can be made. Firstly, IBATis are effective in reducing sBA concentrations not only in PFIC and ALGS and might also be a valuable tool in selected patients with other obstructive conditions such as biliary atresia or sclerosing cholangitis. However, if the indication is limited to pruritus, the window of opportunity under such conditions, where pruritus is a late symptom of advanced disease, would likely be missed. As mentioned above, PFICs or ALGS patients who benefit most from this treatment are those who show moderate cholestasis with some residual ability to transport BAs in bile. In these patients, especially in conditions with biliary pathogenesis such as ALGS or MDR deficiency, pruritus may respond to rifampicin in the early stages and become refractory as fibrosis and obstruction progress. In these situations, it might be reasonable to consider IBATis as the first line of treatment, and this will become even easier with the reduction in treatment costs that is likely to occur in the coming years.</p><p>Finally, there are reports on the effectiveness of IBATis even in conditions that are not necessarily chronic, such as cholestatic drug-induced liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-pediatrrep-18-00019">84</xref>]. The EXPAND study (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT06553768" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT06553768</ext-link>) is currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of maralixibat in the treatment of cholestatic pruritus under different pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-pediatrrep-18-00019" sec-type="conclusions"><title>10. Conclusions</title><p>Based on the data published to date (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pediatrrep-18-00019-t003">Table 3</xref>), we can reasonably conclude that IBATis are now a well-established treatment for cholestatic pruritus. Even though IBATis are currently labelled only for PFIC and ALGS, it is highly desirable that in the future IBATis will become part of the pediatric hepatologist’s toolbox for the treatment of cholestasis in all situations that may benefit from a significant reduction in sBA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
