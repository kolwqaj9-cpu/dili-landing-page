Objective: Unusual clinical course
</p><sec><title>Background</title><p>Drug-induced liver injury is a major cause of acute hepatitis and liver failure, with presentations ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatic dysfunction. Diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury is challenging because it mimics other hepatic disorders and requires careful exclusion of alternative etiologies. Losartan, a commonly prescribed angiotensin II receptor blocker for hypertension, is generally safe, but rare cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Case Report</title><p>A 59-year-old South African woman with newly diagnosed hypertension was started on losartan 100 mg daily. After 1 month, she presented with a 3-month history of belching, right-sided back pain, right upper-quadrant discomfort, and dyspepsia. She had no fever, jaundice, alcohol use, or exposure to other hepatotoxins. Laboratory test results revealed markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (640 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (341 IU/L), with mildly increased alkaline phosphatase (247 IU/L). International normalized ratio, albumin, full blood count, renal function, electrolytes, thyroid profile, and coagulation results were normal. Viral, autoimmune, metabolic, and infectious causes were excluded. Abdominal ultrasound and MRCP showed no abnormalities. Losartan was discontinued and replaced with amlodipine. Liver enzymes improved rapidly and normalized within 1 month, with complete and sustained normalization at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although rare, losartan-induced hepatotoxicity should be considered in patients with otherwise unexplained liver enzyme elevation. Early recognition, thorough exclusion of other causes, and prompt discontinuation of losartan typically lead to full recovery, emphasizing the need for timely evaluation in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Losartan</kwd><kwd>Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury</kwd><kwd>Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists</kwd><kwd>Case Reports</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of acute liver failure in developed countries and remains challenging to diagnose because of its diverse clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes to fulminant hepatic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-amjcaserep-27-e949256">1</xref>]. Epidemiological data show that although DILI is relatively uncommon, it constitutes a significant and increasingly recognized cause of liver-related morbidity worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-amjcaserep-27-e949256">2</xref>]. DILI accounts for a substantial proportion of acute hepatitis and acute liver failure cases, with its incidence influenced by widespread medication use and global variations in prescribing patterns. Antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiepileptic medications are among the most frequently implicated drug classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-amjcaserep-27-e949256">3</xref>].</p><p>DILI is broadly categorized as intrinsic (dose-dependent and predictable) or idiosyncratic (dose-independent and unpredictable), with the latter constituting the majority of clinically significant cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-amjcaserep-27-e949256">4</xref>]. The pathogenesis of idiosyncratic DILI is multifactorial and can involve immune-mediated mechanisms, metabolic activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inter-individual susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-amjcaserep-27-e949256">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-amjcaserep-27-e949256">6</xref>]. Mitochondrial injury can impair oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, whereas increased reactive oxygen species generation contributes to lipid peroxidation and hepatocellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-amjcaserep-27-e949256">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-amjcaserep-27-e949256">7</xref>]. Additional insights into DILI pathophysiology have emerged from drug responses observed during the COVID-19 era, highlighting the complex interactions between drug metabolism, host factors, and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-amjcaserep-27-e949256">8</xref>]. The severity of DILI varies widely; Hy’s law criteria are applied clinically to identify patients at high risk for acute liver failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-amjcaserep-27-e949256">9</xref>]. Hospital-based studies further emphasize that DILI accounts for a notable proportion of hepatology-related admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-amjcaserep-27-e949256">10</xref>].</p><p>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy and generally possess an excellent safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-amjcaserep-27-e949256">11</xref>]. However, hepatotoxicity, while rare, has been documented with ARBs, including losartan and olmesartan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-amjcaserep-27-e949256">12</xref>]. Registry data confirm that ARBs are recognized, although infrequent, causes of idiosyncratic DILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-amjcaserep-27-e949256">13</xref>].</p><p>Losartan remains one of the most commonly prescribed ARBs worldwide. Despite its overall favorable safety characteristics, a growing body of literature reports cases of losartan-induced hepatotoxicity, with clinical presentations ranging from mild enzyme elevations to severe mixed or hepatocellular injury. We present the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed significant liver enzyme elevation after initiating losartan therapy, with complete biochemical normalization following drug withdrawal, supporting a diagnosis of losartan-induced DILI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case Report</title><p>A 59-year-old South African woman presented with a 3-month history of belching, right-sided back pain, right upper quadrant discomfort, and dyspepsia. During this period, she denied fever, jaundice, vomiting, cough, urinary symptoms, rash, alcohol use, or exposure to hepatotoxins. Her past medical history included <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> gastritis treated repeatedly over 10 years, anal fissure surgery performed 15 years earlier, mild dyslipidemia, and newly diagnosed hypertension. One month before her presentation, she had been started on losartan 100 mg daily, and she had never previously exhibited abnormal liver enzyme levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>At the time of evaluation, her vital signs were stable. Physical examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness without hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, stigmata of chronic liver disease, or jaundice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Initial laboratory investigations demonstrated markedly elevated liver enzymes: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 640 IU/L (reference range, 12–78 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 341 IU/L (15–37 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 247 IU/L (45–117 IU/L); total bilirubin, 5.5 μmol/L (3–17 μmol/L); and direct bilirubin, 3.0 μmol/L (0–8.6 μmol/L). Other laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, renal profile, and thyroid function tests, coagulation profile, and serum albumin, all were within normal limits. Extensive etiological workup showed negative results for viral hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, autoimmune markers, antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti–liver kidney microsomal antibody, metabolic causes, malaria smear, and urinalysis. Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated normal hepatobiliary anatomy.</p><p>Follow-up testing 2 weeks later showed partial improvement in ALT to 533 IU/L and AST to 224 IU/L; however, ALP increased to 344 IU/L. After 2 months, liver enzymes remained elevated – ALT, 494 IU/L; AST, 255 IU/L; and ALP, 279 IU/L – but demonstrated a downward trend from baseline values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-amjcaserep-27-e949256">2</xref>). A liver biopsy was deferred because it was invasive and clinically unnecessary, given the patient’s rapid biochemical improvement after discontinuing losartan. Therefore, histopathology was unavailable, and the diagnosis was made clinically, supported by the marked improvement after losartan was replaced with amlodipine, which resulted in complete normalization of liver enzymes within 1 month.</p><sec><title>Management and Outcome</title><p>Losartan was discontinued and replaced with amlodipine 5 mg daily. No specific hepatoprotective drugs were used. The patient improved clinically and biochemically within 1 month, with complete normalization of liver enzymes. Six-month follow-up confirmed sustained normalization of liver function and complete recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case highlights that losartan, although widely regarded as a safe antihypertensive agent, can rarely cause clinically significant DILI. It also shows that the pattern of injury can be mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic, and that early recognition and withdrawal of the drug can lead to complete recovery.</p><p>ARB-related hepatotoxicity, although uncommon, has been reported in association with several agents. Losartan is the most frequently implicated ARB in published case reports, with injuries ranging from asymptomatic enzyme elevation to severe hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-amjcaserep-27-e949256">2</xref>].</p><p>The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARB-induced liver injury are not fully clear, but several hypotheses have been proposed. Oxidative stress is considered a major contributor: ARBs can increase reactive oxygen species formation, leading to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial injury, and hepatocellular damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction can occur through impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ATP synthesis, and destabilization of mitochondrial membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-amjcaserep-27-e949256">5</xref>]. Losartan undergoes cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation primarily via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to form its active metabolite EXP3174; this process can generate reactive intermediates capable of forming protein adducts and triggering cellular injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-amjcaserep-27-e949256">5</xref>]. Immune-mediated mechanisms have also been implicated, with drug-protein adducts potentially activating innate and adaptive immune pathways and promoting hepatocellular inflammation. Cytokine-mediated injury involving tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6, as well as genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism and detoxification pathways, can modulate individual susceptibility; reduced glutathione stores and impaired antioxidant defenses further potentiate reactive oxygen species–mediated hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-amjcaserep-27-e949256">6</xref>]. Together, these mechanisms illustrate how losartan may induce idiosyncratic liver injury in predisposed individuals.</p><p>Tarantino and Finelli reported a losartan-induced hepatocellular liver injury that resolved completely after drug withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-amjcaserep-27-e949256">14</xref>]. Al-Halawani et al described a patient who developed significant enzyme elevation months after treatment initiation, with full recovery after discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-amjcaserep-27-e949256">15</xref>]. Midtvedt et al documented severe hepatocellular injury occurring within weeks of losartan initiation, resolving rapidly after withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-amjcaserep-27-e949256">16</xref>]. Nygaard and Strandgaard reported marked aminotransferase elevations that normalized after ceasing therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-amjcaserep-27-e949256">17</xref>].</p><p>Rechallenge has been shown to precipitate rapid and more severe recurrence of hepatotoxicity. Patti et al described a case of massive hepatocellular injury following re-exposure, underscoring the importance of avoiding rechallenge once DILI is suspected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-amjcaserep-27-e949256">18</xref>]. Diogo et al similarly reported a rechallenge case with severe recurrent hepatotoxicity and gradual recovery following definitive discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-amjcaserep-27-e949256">19</xref>]. Zahedi et al detailed a case involving severe hepatocellular injury with jaundice and altered sensorium shortly after losartan initiation, with improvement following withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-amjcaserep-27-e949256">20</xref>]. A biopsy-confirmed Tunisian case progressed to sub-fulminant hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy despite drug discontinuation, demonstrating that losartan-induced DILI can be fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-amjcaserep-27-e949256">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-amjcaserep-27-e949256">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Across the literature, the latency period between losartan initiation and onset of DILI ranges from days to months. The hepatocellular pattern is most common, although cholestatic and mixed patterns are also observed. In nearly all non-fatal cases, early drug withdrawal is associated with complete biochemical recovery.</p><p>In our patient, the R-ratio (3.9) indicated a mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic pattern, which is less commonly reported than the predominantly hepatocellular pattern described in earlier literature. The clear temporal relationship between drug initiation and biochemical injury, exclusion of alternative etiologies, and prompt improvement after cessation support losartan as the causative agent. This case reinforces the need for vigilance when evaluating new-onset liver enzyme abnormalities in patients receiving losartan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Losartan-induced DILI is rare but clinically important. This case adds to the growing body of evidence that losartan can cause idiosyncratic liver injury with variable biochemical patterns, including mixed hepatocellular–cholestatic injury. Careful review of the medication history is essential in any patient presenting with new-onset liver enzyme elevation. Prompt recognition and withdrawal of the offending agent usually result in complete recovery, whereas rechallenge can lead to more severe injury. In patients with suspected losartan-induced DILI, alternative antihypertensive therapies should be selected and re-exposure to losartan avoided.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the use of an AI-based language model (ChatGPT, OpenAI) for assistance with language editing and organization.
