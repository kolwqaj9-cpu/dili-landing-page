It displays different clinical manifestations, being the cutaneous form (CL) the most common. This presents as skin ulcers that produce significant psychosocial distress, lifelong scarring and stigmatization. Historically endemic in low-income regions in the tropics, epidemiological data and computational models forecast the continued expansion into regions further away from the Equator, both northwards and southwards. Treatments for CL are unsatisfactory and are currently the major unmet medical need for the leishmaniases. An inherent difficulty with using the available systemic drugs is that they are highly toxic and painful to administer and require second-level hospital infrastructure to manage side effects. In this context, local treatments, and in particular topical treatments for CL are particularly interesting due to their potential to be efficacious and less toxic, painful and inconvenient than systemic treatments. They could improve patient compliance and allow self-treatment, diminishing associated financial costs both for the patients and for the states that usually provide the treatments. In this work we discuss epidemiology of the disease and availability of treatments and then center on topical treatments, covering advances in preclinical and clinical studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cutaneous leishmaniasis</kwd><kwd>availability</kwd><kwd>topical treatments</kwd><kwd>neglected tropical disease</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

It is transmitted from a mammal reservoir to humans by a phlebotomine insect (sand fly), and displays different clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic or subclinical infection to disfiguring forms of cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous, (MCL) or potentially fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The polymorphic outcome of <italic toggle="yes">Leishmania</italic> infection depends on the virulence of the infecting parasite strain, as well as the host’s immune response. CL is the most common form, presenting as skin lesions that may lead to lifelong scarring and stigmatization. Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, seen in the Eastern hemisphere, is caused by <italic toggle="yes">L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major, L. tropica and L. aethiopica</italic>, while New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, which refers to American cases, is predominantly caused by <italic toggle="yes">L. braziliensis, L. panamensis, L. guyanensis, L. amazonensis, L. mexicana and L. peruviana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118">Madusanka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Leishmaniasis is endemic in more than 90 countries, with the highest burden present in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Latin America. It is estimated that 600,000 – 1 M new cases occur each year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the geographic distribution is rapidly evolving due to climate change, deforestation and global warming, factors that facilitate sandfly habitat extension and contact with humans. Historically endemic in low-income regions in the tropics, CL has become a public health challenge also in high-income countries. The data forecast the continued expansion into regions further away from the Equator, both northwards and southwards.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Evolution of the number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases, by WHO region, 1999–2023.

While rarely fatal, the disease imposes a severe burden on affected individuals. Stigma, depression, and economic losses affect most of the patients, particularly in low-resource settings. It is estimated that over 40 million individuals may live with the long-term consequences of past CL infections. Although CL ultimately self-cures, it has a substantial morbidity due to the long presence of a skin ulcer, usually in a part of the body that is visible, and the psychosociological impact of disfigurement, which produces depression and oftentimes discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Bern et al., 2008</xref>). In some regions of Latin America, the disease is associated with the forest-dwelling guerrilla, adding a layer of social discrimination.</p><p>An inherent difficulty with using anti-VL drugs for CL is that the benefit may outweigh the toxicity of systemic agents for a fatal disease such as VL, but such toxicity may be harder to justify for a non-fatal disease such as CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref141">Murray et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, treatment of CL is unsatisfactory and is currently the major unmet medical need for the leishmaniases. Treatment of the disease depends on the parasite species, the host, the endemic region, socioeconomic status, and the availability of medical care.</p><p>Being CL not a life-threatening disease, its prevention and treatment is not given the priority it should have. CL remains an unpreventable disease, with no vaccine still available for humans, therefore novel therapies are urgently necessary. A new approach for CL treatment favored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other experts is the use of a local treatment followed by parenteral treatment only if the local treatment fails or cannot be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">González et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9026">Pinart et al., 2020</xref>). Treatment options are limited, with existing therapies being either toxic and painful or less toxic and easier to administer but prohibitively costly or inaccessible. Topical treatments for CL are particularly interesting due to their potential to be efficacious, and less toxic/painful than systemic treatments. They could improve patient compliance and allow self-treatment, diminishing associated financial costs both for the patients and for the states that usually provide the treatments.</p><p>Local treatments such as photodynamic, thermal and cryotherapy have proven to be efficacious alternatives to systemic treatments in some cases. These treatments have been reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">Garza-Tovar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref150">Orabi et al., 2023</xref>). In this work we focus on topical treatments for CL. We discuss epidemiology of the disease and availability of treatments and then center on topical treatments, covering advances in preclinical and clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Epidemiology</title><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), including CL, have shown a rising global incidence since 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">Ruiz-Postigo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">IHME, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">GBD, 2019</xref>). Since they are predominantly disablers rather than killers, their burden is best measured using DALYs (years of healthy life lost to premature death and disability, estimated from incidence and prevalence data). This metric however still overlooks the economic and psychosocial impacts of the disease. The real burden of the disease is difficult to estimate, with studies such as the Global Burden of Disease being criticized for underestimating reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Bailey et al., 2017</xref>). Leishmaniasis ranked as the fourth most serious NTD in terms of DALYs in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">Hotez et al., 2014</xref>), with tegumentary leishmaniasis (CL and MCL) experiencing the greatest DALYs increase among NTDs between 1999 and 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">Herricks et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CL’s epidemiological burden is significant, with 45% of reporting countries now considered endemic. The disease is concentrated in the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, and East Africa regions and is increasingly affecting children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">WHO 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref95">Knight, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">Haftom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">PAHO, 2024b</xref>). Global case numbers have steadily risen since 1999, peaking in 2019 before declining during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2023, cases had returned to pre-pandemic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">Jain et al., 2024</xref>). The highest incidence of NTDs has been historically observed in tropical and sub-tropical (mostly low-income) regions of the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref200">Stolk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Collis et al., 2019</xref>). Between 1990 and 2019, higher income regions experienced increasing incidence, whereas low-middle income regions remained stable and low-income regions presented a decreased incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">Ruiz-Postigo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2015</xref>). In 2023–2024 the global trend was mainly due to the trend in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although there is a significant underreporting in Europe, the Western Pacific, and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">Ruiz-Postigo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">WHO, 2024</xref>). Tegumentary leishmaniasis has an equal impact in females and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">Ruiz-Postigo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">Scheufele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">Jain et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Infected animals, sandfly habitats and locally infected patients are now present in new regions. Climate change, global warming and displacement of people due to conflict are critical drivers of CL’s spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">Githeko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">López et al., 2016</xref>). In the last ten years, autochthonous cases have been reported in the USA (Texas, Oklahoma, Florida and Arizona), East Europe, and Southern Europe, where the disease is recognized as endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">GHO, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">WHO, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">Scheufele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref200">Stolk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">Maia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">Hotez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">McIlwee et al., 2018</xref>). Also in these high-income regions, the disease is prevalent among people living in poverty. This is not a negligible amount of the population, reaching more than 35% of children in the state of Texas, USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">Hotez, 2018</xref>). A northwards trend of expansion of the disease has been observed both in Europe and in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref220">Wright et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">Kipp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">McIlwee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">Scheufele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">Maia et al., 2023</xref>). Domestic dogs are an important reservoir of leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Abuzaid et al., 2020</xref>). Now, roughly 10% of dogs in Southwestern Europe are carriers of canine leishmaniasis, and forecasting models predict continued northward expansion of sandfly distribution into Southern Canada and Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">Koch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">González et al., 2010</xref>). The same trend is observed in the Southern Hemisphere, with leishmaniasis cases in dogs appearing for the first time in history in previously disease-free central Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">García Campos et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130">Ministerio de Salud de la Provincia de Córdoba, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">Visintin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The psychosocial and economic consequences of CL are profound, with over 40 million individuals potentially living with long-term effects of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Bailey et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these burdens, tools for large-scale control remain inadequate, and under-recognition of disease prevalence continues to skew estimates in global health studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">Mitra and Mawson, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Availability and cost of leishmaniasis treatments</title><p>Leishmaniasis is associated with poverty, even in high-income countries, and perpetuates the cycle of poverty and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref218">Wijerathna et al., 2018</xref>). The financial impact on healthcare systems and patients is substantial. The global market for anti-leishmaniasis drugs, valued at $4 to $7 billion annually, faces challenges such as limited funding, reliance on sole suppliers, and supply shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Choi et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref> shows the estimated cost of leishmaniasis treatment in different regions. Costs include medication and direct treatment expenses. Drug costs constitute over 60% of the total treatment expenses across all therapies, and vary widely when comparing WHO negotiated prices, prices resulting of an agreement with a pharmaceutical company or actual market prices or the drugs. Although there is a wide variety of treatments, they remain largely inaccessible in endemic countries: their prices are high and highly variable; many products lack approval by the regulatory authorities, the existence of a single manufacturer hinders price negotiations (liposomal Amphotericin B and miltefosine). Donor dependency and lack of (reliable) local manufacturing further complicate the issue.

Initially, the program was set to run until 2022, but in April 2021, the UK government reduced its funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Davies, 2022</xref>). After ASCEND’s withdrawal, in August 2021, the END Fund (Ending Neglected Diseases), with support from ELMA Philanthropies, funded four organizations to continue initiatives in five East African countries. However, the disruption of ASCEND impacted service delivery in some healthcare facilities, while reliance on expensive donor-funded medications further worsened the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Davies, 2022</xref>). An international organization that plays a crucial role in ensuring the availability of essential medicines in endemic countries of the Americas is the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO).

Topical therapies are also easier to administer, as they can be self-applied without the need for frequent visits to healthcare centers. This is particularly advantageous in resource-limited regions where these services are distant, reducing costs for patients and their families. Moreover, the production cost of a topical treatment is lower than that of a parenteral treatment, which should result in a more affordable market price for the formulation.

The results consistently highlight the complex interplay between host/parasite interaction and genetics, vector factors, and environmental conditions. To increase the translational value of data obtained from mouse models, an extra step—adding a layer of complexity to experimental design—could prove beneficial. This might involve using murine models with diverse genetic backgrounds (e.g., wild-derived strains), including factors associated with the vector (e.g., mosquito saliva components), or co-housing with non-specific pathogen free mice (such as pet store mice) to better mimic the complexity of human infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">de Oliveira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">Lipoldová and Demant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">Kobets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">Soong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">Loria-Cervera and Andrade-Narvaez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116">Loureiro Salgado et al., 2022</xref>). Also, the use of the novel bioengineered human tissue/organoids which can show a high clinical mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">Loewa et al., 2023</xref>) shows important promise.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref> we compile some of the research carried out in the mouse model during the last five years to tackle CL with a topical approach. The aim of this section is to highlight what we identify as trends in CL therapies but is not an exhaustive revision, which can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">Lafleur et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">Maza Vega et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Afonso et al., 2023</xref>). We identified two streams of research, the first looking to improve the efficacy of traditional drugs through carriers, enhancers or combined-drug therapy, while the second identifies compounds with antileishmanial activity, whether they are readily available in the market (repurposed drugs) or waiting to be discovered in nature (natural compounds). To improve the efficacy of traditional drugs the strategy is based on the implementation of combined therapies looking for synergistic effects of drugs, or the use of immunomodulatory agents to enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratio. The search takes advantage of novel nano-drug delivery systems that can transport antileishmanial drugs to their target organ, reducing adverse effects. Regardless of the approach chosen, the major issue identified from these studies is the lack of standardization (i.e., the size of inoculum, the site and method of inoculation and the starting treatment time) in experimental designs, which makes the comparison between the findings of different groups difficult.</p><table-wrap id="tab3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Preclinical studies of topical treatment for CL in mice.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Reference</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Species</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Inoculum size</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">SOI</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Therapy</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">SOT</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Schema</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">FU (after the EOT)</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="9" rowspan="1" style="background-color:#b7b7b7" valign="middle">Traditional drugs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="middle">

A most important obstacle to the translation of these results are the high costs involved and the lack of interest of big pharmaceutical companies. For example, a search of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ClinicalTrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (accessed February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2025) with the keywords “cutaneous leishmaniasis” + “topical administration” retrieves 27 entries. All of them are sponsored by universities, state-owned research facilities or NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations). In general, and most likely due to a lack of stronger funding, the studies do not comprise multi-centered studies with large numbers of patients.

It was developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, an institution based in the USA and financed by the US Department of Defense. Intended for the treatment of uncomplicated CL, it has been studied in randomized phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials. The trials were conducted both in New World (Colombia and Panama) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Soto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Sosa et al., 2019</xref>) and in Old World (Tunisia and France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">Ben Salah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref179">Ben Salah et al., 2013</xref>) patients. In travelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref138">Mouri et al., 2023</xref>) and soldiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Soto et al., 2002</xref>); in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Soto et al., 2002</xref>), women and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">Ben Salah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref179">Ben Salah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Sosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref191">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>). Children responded very well to the treatment (82–84% cure), which is especially important since this is a group with low adherence and lower cure rates when treated with parenteral medications.</p><p>Only two of the studies were performed against placebo. In the best of these studies (larger number of patients, double blinding, two centers) a higher percentage of patients were cured, and the cure was faster than in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Soto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">Ben Salah et al., 2009</xref>). In later studies, upon once or twice daily application for 20 days, the clinical cure of the index lesion for PM-gentamicin was 79% and for PM alone was 78%. Compliance was excellent (98%) and the efficacy was the same as that of pentavalent antimonials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Sosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref177">Salah et al., 2014</xref>).

Non-occlusive dressing seems to be better than using occlusion, and once daily treatment had the same efficacy as the twice daily scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref177">Salah et al., 2014</xref>). A study of pharmacokinetics with CL patients from two phase 2 clinical trials, both in Latin America, compared 15% PM and 15% PM + 0.5% gentamicin. The percentage of dose absorbed on day 20 was approx. 12 and 10% for PM alone and combination, respectively. PM concentrations in plasma after 20 days of application were 5–9% of those after i.m. administration of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day to adults, indicating that effective topical treatment is possible with low systemic absorption, thus avoiding drug accumulation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref166">Ravis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>With adverse effects that are mild to moderate local irritation, the lesions become bigger at the beginning of treatment and cure after the 20-day treatment; the epithelialization is observed at days 35–42. No relapse is observed up to 180 days and the results are at least as good as with toxic traditional treatments. In summary, although most of the trials were single-centered and with a relatively small number of subjects, the evidence shows that both PM and the combination paromomycin+gentamicin cures 80–94% of patients with both Old or New World uncomplicated CL and can reduce parasite load in the deep dermis up to 77 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Soto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Sosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">Ben Salah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref179">Ben Salah et al., 2013</xref>). Gentamicin does not make the treatment more efficacious, but its presence makes the lesions cure faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Sosa et al., 2019</xref>).

Physical treatments like thermotherapy are effective but also have limitations.</p><p>Inaccessibility of efficacious and less toxic treatments in endemic regions is linked to structural issues such as lack of local manufacturing and donor dependency. Funding cuts in programs like ASCEND further exacerbate this situation. The evidence of efficacy of topical treatments from clinical trials is weak (small or few trials), but a few have very good results. The main problem to increase the solidity of evidence in clinical trials is lack of financing. The pharmaceutical industry is starting to invest in R + D but no new treatments are still on the market, and most of the effort to produce safer, affordable treatment is made by public institutions, universities, and NGOs such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). The lack of interest of pharmaceutical companies may change with the evidence of the emergence of the disease in higher-income countries, although it remains to be seen whether this will improve in any way the availability of treatments for patients in low-resources regions. Given the promising results of some clinical studies, in particular those on topical paromomycin, an efficacious topical treatment can surely be available, especially if the continued commitment of publicly or NGO- funded researchers can be supported by an increased interest from pharmaceutical companies (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="box1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><p>
<bold>BOX 1 A brief summary on Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis</bold>
</p><p>Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic skin sequel of visceral leishmaniasis (VL, also called kala-azar). It is observed mainly in areas endemic for <italic toggle="yes">L. donovani</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref224">Zijlstra, 2025</xref>). Compared to CL, PKDL is a relatively infrequent complication: the WHO states that from 2012 to 2024, a total of 13,515 cases were reported, with the major burden in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">World Health Organization, 2024</xref>). This low incidence however should be taken as a lowest probable number, since underreporting is likely, due to misdiagnosis (mild lesions, appearance years after VL).</p><p>PKDL lesions can appear from 6 months to several years after treatment of VL; they may be hypopigmented macules, papules, nodules, or plaques. Lesions are usually numerous, typically starting on the face and spreading to the trunk and limbs. Some PKDL cases may self-heal over time; in South Asia, lesions usually persist for years without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref164">Ramesh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As PKDL is not a purely local skin disease, representing a systemic persistence of <italic toggle="yes">L.</italic> donovani, systemic drugs are required to fully clear the parasite, prevent relapse, and reduce transmission to sandflies. Topical drugs for PKDL are not established as effective or standard of care, remaining as a minor, investigational niche compared with systemic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref189">Singh-Phulgenda et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">Moulik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref104">Le Rutte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref139">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref214">WHO, 2012</xref>). Miltefosine, liposomal amphotericin B, pentavalent antimonials or combinations of these for 2–4 months are the usual treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref189">Singh-Phulgenda et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref221">Younis et al., 2023</xref>). However, systemic drugs that cure visceral disease may not reach or clear parasites in skin equally; variable skin penetration (and local immune microenvironments) cause treatment failures and relapse. This complicates extrapolating VL regimens to PKDL. In this context, it is important to measure drug concentrations in skin lesions across different drugs and explore higher local exposure (topical formulations, intralesional approaches) or drug delivery systems that increase cutaneous exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref219">Wijnant et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref156">Palić et al., 2024</xref>).</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by" id="fn0001"><p>Edited by: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/807394/overview" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">David Arranz-Solís</ext-link>, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain</p></fn><fn fn-type="reviewed-by" id="fn0002"><p>Reviewed by: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/755993/overview" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Patrick Valere Tsouh Fokou</ext-link>, The University of Bamenda, Cameroon</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/928384/overview" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Danilo Ciccone Miguel</ext-link>, State University of Campinas, Brazil</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="sec22" sec-type="author-contributions"><title>Author contributions</title><p>DC: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review &amp; editing.
