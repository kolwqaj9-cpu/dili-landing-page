Among these, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies have emerged as pivotal therapeutic modalities across a wide spectrum of malignancies, including gastrointestinal (GI) cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and HER2-positive gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These therapies offer the advantage of specificity, often achieving significant improvements in survival, disease control, and quality of life.</p><p>However, alongside these therapeutic advances, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the potential for these agents to cause a variety of off-target toxicities, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, the GI toxicities associated with targeted therapies are often idiosyncratic, variable in onset and severity, and mechanistically distinct across drug classes. They frequently present with histologic and clinical features that overlap with other disease processes, such as infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ischemia, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), leading to diagnostic ambiguity and delays in appropriate management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sunitinib, have been associated with mucosal injury, diarrhea, and ischemic-type colitis through their antiangiogenic and multikinase inhibitory effects. ADCs like trastuzumab deruxtecan and inotuzumab ozogamicin are conjugated with potent cytotoxic payloads, which may cause mucositis, colitis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to direct epithelial injury or bystander effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. CAR-T therapies, although primarily used for hematologic malignancies, have been linked to cytokine-mediated GI inflammation, enteritis, and even colitis, particularly in the setting of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p>Despite the increasing prevalence of these toxicities, current literature remains limited in its coverage of the histopathologic features and clinicopathologic correlations of GI injury secondary to non–immune checkpoint targeted therapies. Pathologists often face challenges in identifying characteristic patterns of injury, especially when clinical histories are incomplete or when biopsy findings mimic other entities. The lack of standardized descriptors or classification systems for these toxicities further complicates pathology reporting and interdisciplinary communication.</p><p>Data derived from regulatory and public health sources such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) reinforce the clinical relevance of this issue. Post-marketing surveillance data have documented thousands of GI adverse events associated with kinase inhibitors and ADCs, yet these findings remain under-integrated into routine practice and academic discourse. Concurrently, epidemiologic datasets like the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program show rising incidence rates of GI malignancies for which these therapies are indicated, underscoring the importance of understanding their toxicity profiles in a population-level context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p>This review aims to provide a comprehensive and pathology-focused synthesis of the gastrointestinal toxicities associated with TKIs, ADCs, and CAR-T cell therapies. By exploring the mechanistic pathways, histopathologic features, regulatory surveillance data, and clinical implications, we seek to empower pathologists, oncologists, and multidisciplinary teams with a practical reference to recognize, report, and manage these emerging toxicities. Ultimately, improved awareness and timely diagnosis will support safer treatment delivery, more effective pharmacovigilance, and higher-quality cancer care.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>OVERVIEW OF NON–IMMUNE CHECKPOINT TARGETED THERAPIES IN GI ONCOLOGY</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)</title><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are among the most established classes of targeted agents in gastrointestinal oncology. They act by blocking intracellular signaling pathways critical for tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), the discovery of activating mutations in KIT and PDGFRA led to the approval of imatinib, which demonstrated unprecedented response rates in advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, resistance is common, necessitating subsequent agents such as sunitinib, regorafenib, and ripretinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. TKIs also play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where sorafenib was the first systemic therapy to improve survival, followed by lenvatinib as an alternative first-line option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. These drugs inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) in addition to other kinases, accounting for both their efficacy and gastrointestinal toxicity, which includes diarrhea, mucosal ulceration, ischemic changes, and bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs)</title><p>ADCs represent a rapidly expanding category of therapies that link monoclonal antibodies with potent cytotoxic payloads. In GI oncology, trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) has emerged as a breakthrough therapy for HER2-positive gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers after progression on trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Clinical trials demonstrated durable responses, though at the cost of significant gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The mechanism of toxicity may involve both on-target damage to normal HER2-expressing epithelial cells and off-target bystander effects from payload release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Other ADCs, such as sacituzumab govitecan (anti–Trop-2) and enfortumab vedotin (anti–Nectin-4), while not yet approved for GI cancers, are under investigation in colorectal and gastric cancer with promising preliminary results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR-T) therapy</title><p>CAR-T cell therapy has transformed the treatment of hematologic malignancies and is now being explored for gastrointestinal cancers. Early-phase trials have targeted antigens such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), claudin 18.2, and glypican-3 in gastric, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. While clinical efficacy in solid tumors remains modest, CAR-T therapy is associated with distinct toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). These systemic inflammatory responses frequently involve the gastrointestinal tract, producing colitis, enteritis, and, in rare cases, gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Histologically, these lesions can mimic inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis, underscoring the role of pathology in differential diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Bispecific antibodies</title><p>Bispecific antibodies, particularly CD3-directed T-cell engagers such as teclistamab, epcoritamab, and blinatumomab, represent an emerging class of non–checkpoint immunotherapies with expanding use across hematologic and select solid malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. These agents bind CD3 on T cells and a tumor-associated antigen (e.g., BCMA, CD20, HER2), inducing potent T-cell activation and targeted cytotoxicity. Similar to CAR-T therapies, this immune synapse formation triggers cytokine release, most commonly IL-6 and IL-1β, which can manifest clinically as CRS-associated diarrhea and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Gastrointestinal toxicities include diarrhea, immune-mediated enterocolitis (uncommon but documented), and mucosal apoptosis during high-grade cytokine activation. Unlike CAR-T–associated GI injury, which often appears during or after CRS escalation, bispecific antibody–related GI events tend to occur earlier in the step-up dosing phase, reflecting their rapid and repeat T-cell stimulation kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>Other targeted therapies of relevance</title><p>In addition to TKIs, ADCs, and CAR-T, other targeted therapies contribute to gastrointestinal oncology. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus is approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and has shown activity in HCC, with gastrointestinal side effects such as stomatitis, diarrhea, and enteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including olaparib and rucaparib, though more established in ovarian and breast cancers, have shown activity in GI cancers harboring BRCA mutations or homologous recombination deficiency, sometimes producing gastrointestinal toxicities such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and inhibitors of epigenetic regulators are in early development for GI malignancies and will likely expand the spectrum of potential gastrointestinal adverse events in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].

Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, which causes predictable mucosal injury through cell-cycle inhibition, targeted therapies produce heterogeneous patterns of toxicity that reflect both on-target and off-target mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for interpreting histopathologic findings and guiding patient management.</p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Direct epithelial injury and disruption of stem cell niche</title><p>Several targeted agents exert direct cytotoxic effects on gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are the prototypical example, as their payloads—typically topoisomerase inhibitors or microtubule-disrupting agents can be released within normal mucosal cells or diffuse into surrounding tissues. Trastuzumab deruxtecan, for example, has been associated with mucositis, diarrhea, and colitis due to bystander epithelial damage in HER2-expressing mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Similarly, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors induce DNA repair defects that sensitize rapidly dividing gastrointestinal epithelial cells to injury, leading to diarrhea and mucosal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p>Targeted therapies may also disrupt the intestinal epithelial stem cell niche, an emerging and increasingly recognized mechanism of injury. The regenerative capacity of the gastrointestinal mucosa depends on LGR5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells residing at the crypt base, supported by a tightly regulated microenvironment shaped by Wnt, Notch, EGFR, and mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Several targeted agents particularly TKIs, mTOR inhibitors, and select ADCs can perturb these pathways, leading to impaired stem cell renewal, delayed crypt regeneration, and heightened vulnerability to mucosal stress. Disruption of the niche may manifest histologically as crypt dropout, blunted regenerative response, or increased apoptosis, contributing to prolonged diarrhea, mucosal atrophy, and delayed healing even after drug discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. This evolving concept underscores how targeted therapy–induced epithelial injury extends beyond direct cytotoxicity to include dysregulation of epithelial homeostasis and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>Anti-angiogenic and ischemic mechanisms</title><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with anti-VEGFR activity can cause gastrointestinal ischemia and ulceration by disrupting vascular integrity. Sorafenib, regorafenib, and lenvatinib are known to reduce microvascular density in the intestinal mucosa, predisposing to ischemic-type colitis and gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Histologically, these lesions often display mucosal necrosis, thrombosed capillaries, and lamina propria hyalinization, mimicking ischemic colitis from vascular disease. Such vascular-mediated injury distinguishes VEGF-targeted TKIs from other classes of targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s3_3"><title>Apoptotic enteropathy and crypt injury</title><p>Agents that modulate downstream signaling pathways, including mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus, induce characteristic patterns of apoptotic injury in the gastrointestinal tract. These lesions may resemble graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or immune checkpoint inhibitor–related enterocolitis, with apoptotic bodies in crypt bases and focal crypt dropout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Recognition of this mechanism is essential to avoid misdiagnosis, as the clinical management differs significantly from GVHD or infectious etiologies.</p></sec><sec id="s3_4"><title>Immune-mediated and cytokine-driven toxicity</title><p>CAR-T cell therapy represents a distinct paradigm of gastrointestinal toxicity mediated by immune hyperactivation rather than direct tissue targeting. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) produces high systemic levels of interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which can disrupt mucosal immune homeostasis and lead to colitis or enteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Pathology specimens often reveal mixed inflammatory infiltrates, crypt apoptosis, and mucosal ulceration, sometimes indistinguishable from autoimmune colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. The overlap with infectious and inflammatory conditions necessitates careful clinicopathologic correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s3_5"><title>Microbiome dysregulation</title><p>Emerging data suggest that targeted therapies can alter the gut microbiome, which may contribute to gastrointestinal toxicity. TKIs such as sunitinib and cabozantinib have been shown to disrupt microbial diversity, increasing the abundance of pro-inflammatory taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. These alterations may potentiate mucosal immune activation, lower the threshold for diarrhea, and exacerbate colitis. Although still under active investigation, microbiome disruption may partially explain interpatient variability in toxicity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3_6"><title>Off-target kinase inhibition</title><p>TKIs frequently inhibit multiple kinases beyond their intended oncogenic target, and this polypharmacology accounts for a broad range of off-target gastrointestinal effects. Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-KIT in normal intestinal cells contributes to impaired mucosal repair, while off-target inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can promote diarrhea and epithelial atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. Recognition of these off-target effects helps explain why toxicity profiles vary substantially between TKIs despite shared primary targets.

Time to onset is variable ranging from days for cytotoxic-payload–driven mucositis to weeks for anti-angiogenic ischemic patterns and histology often overlaps with infection, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia, or immune-mediated injury. Close clinicopathologic correlation, awareness of class-specific signatures, and knowledge of regulatory safety data are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment interruption.</p><sec id="s4_1"><title>Upper GI tract (esophagus and stomach)</title><p>Upper-tract toxicity most often reflects epithelial-injury and anti-angiogenic effects. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) such as trastuzumab deruxtecan produce prominent nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, and dyspepsia; endoscopy may show erythematous or erosive gastritis, and biopsies demonstrate surface erosion with apoptotic epithelial damage attributable to topoisomerase-I payload bystander effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].

VEGFR-targeting TKIs (e.g., regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib) produce ischemic-type colitis or ulceration with segmental distribution, hemorrhage, and endoscopic dusky mucosa; biopsies reveal ischemic injury with superficial necrosis and lamina propria hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. mTOR inhibition (everolimus) and cytotoxic-payload ADCs may cause an apoptotic colitis/enteropathy pattern with increased crypt-base apoptosis and focal crypt dropout that can mimic graft-versus-host disease or checkpoint-inhibitor colitis; recognition of prominent apoptosis with relatively scant chronic architectural distortion supports a drug effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Irinotecan-analog payloads (e.g., sacituzumab govitecan) are linked to severe diarrhea and colitis; supportive care and, when indicated, antidiarrheals are standard while invasive infection is excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. CAR-T–associated systemic inflammation can manifest as colitis with mixed inflammatory infiltrates, crypt apoptosis, and erosions, often temporally related to cytokine release syndrome; pathologic features overlap with autoimmune colitis, necessitating integration of treatment timeline and biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Pancreas</title><p>Pancreatic toxicity is uncommon but reported with selected TKIs and mTOR inhibitors. Clinical presentations include asymptomatic enzyme elevations to acute pancreatitis. When pancreatitis occurs, it is typically early, reversible with drug interruption, and confounded by gallstone disease or hypertriglyceridemia; imaging may be normal or show interstitial edema. Package inserts for sunitinib and sorafenib acknowledge pancreatitis as a post-marketing event; management is supportive with temporary cessation and rechallenge only after resolution and exclusion of alternative causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>].

Multi-kinase inhibitors such as regorafenib carry a boxed warning for severe drug-induced liver injury; patterns include hepatocellular transaminitis with possible jaundice, typically within the first two months of therapy, warranting close laboratory monitoring and prompt dose modification per label guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. PI3Kδ inhibition with idelalisib is associated with high-grade transaminase elevations and, rarely, cholestatic injury; risk is greatest in the initial 12 weeks and improves with interruption or dose reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (anti-CD22 ADC) confers a clinically meaningful risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease, particularly around hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation; pathogenesis reflects endothelial-sinusoidal injury from the calicheamicin payload, and prevention centers on exposure minimization and transplant-timing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>].

Histology reveals surface necrosis, withered crypts, lamina propria hemorrhage, hyalinization, and thrombotic microangiopathy of mucosal capillaries. Unlike vascular occlusion from atherosclerotic disease, these changes are diffuse, often segmental, and temporally associated with TKI therapy.

Histology may show neutrophil-rich exudates and fibrinopurulent debris, resembling infectious colitis. Microbiologic testing is essential to rule out <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> or viral pathogens. In drug-induced settings, chronic architectural distortion is absent, helping to distinguish these lesions from idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s5_4"><title>Mixed inflammatory and autoimmune-like patterns</title><p>CAR-T–associated gastrointestinal toxicity is driven by systemic cytokine release and may manifest as mixed inflammatory infiltrates with crypt apoptosis, erosions, and ulceration. Pathologic features overlap substantially with autoimmune colitis and checkpoint inhibitor toxicity. In such cases, correlation with treatment timeline, cytokine release syndrome, and systemic biomarkers (e.g., elevated IL-6) supports the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s5_5"><title>Hepatobiliary lesions</title><p>Targeted therapies also produce distinct hepatobiliary histopathology. Regorafenib and other TKIs can induce hepatocellular injury with lobular necrosis and cholestasis, while inotuzumab ozogamicin may cause hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), showing sinusoidal dilatation, centrilobular congestion, and perisinusoidal fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>].

FAERS enables hypothesis generation but is not designed to prove causality or provide incidence; FDA labels enumerate event rates under defined study conditions but can under-represent rare or delayed toxicities.

Such collaboration not only improves outcomes but also contributes to pharmacovigilance by facilitating accurate adverse event reporting.</p><p>For pathologists, awareness of drug-specific injury patterns can transform biopsy interpretation. An ischemic-type pattern in a regorafenib-treated patient, or apoptotic enteropathy in an everolimus-treated patient, should prompt direct mention of “compatible with targeted-therapy toxicity” in the pathology report, thereby shortening diagnostic timelines and avoiding unnecessary investigations. This patient-safety role is central to pathology’s contribution to modern oncology. Clinical management pathway is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

For pathology and oncology services that routinely encounter gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events from these agents, aligning local practice with national frameworks strengthens patient safety and improves signal detection.</p><sec id="s8_1"><title>Pharmacovigilance infrastructure and reporting</title><p>At the federal level, two complementary systems underpin drug-safety surveillance. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) aggregates spontaneous reports from clinicians, manufacturers, and patients and provides a public dashboard for drug- and event-specific queries and data export. FAERS is indispensable for signal detection, although it cannot estimate incidence or prove causality and must be interpreted alongside trial and label data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]. Clinicians can (and should) submit suspected adverse events directly through FDA MedWatch using the online portal or FDA Form 3500 for health professionals; instructions and form fields explicitly support reporting of clinical findings, diagnostics, and narrative causality assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>]. Beyond spontaneous reports, the FDA’s Sentinel Initiative conducts active surveillance using large, curated electronic healthcare datasets to evaluate safety questions at scale, enabling more rapid, population-level assessments when signals emerge in FAERS or literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s8_2"><title>Risk evaluation programs and recent regulatory changes</title><p>For high-risk products, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure benefits outweigh risks and to formalize elements to assure safe use (e.g., site certification, drug-specific monitoring). REMS are imposed on a limited subset of products and are periodically re-evaluated as evidence evolves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. In June 2025, the FDA eliminated the REMS requirements for currently approved BCMA- and CD19-directed autologous CAR-T cell therapies after determining that existing labeling and risk-communication tools were sufficient; updated labeling reflects this policy change. This removal reduces administrative burden without changing the expectation for facilities to maintain readiness (e.g., access to tocilizumab, escalation protocols) when treating patients at risk for cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>]. These developments illustrate how risk-mitigation obligations can change over time and should be monitored by institutions providing advanced cell therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s8_3"><title>Standardized toxicity grading and patient-reported outcomes</title><p>Uniform grading enables consistent management and cross-study comparability. The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is the U.S. standard for defining and grading adverse events in oncology; the current release is CTCAE v6.0 (2025), which updates terms, grades, and MedDRA mappings used in trials and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. Because many GI toxicities are symptomatic, integrating patient-reported outcomes improves detection and timeliness. The NCI’s PRO-CTCAE system provides validated items and form builders for capturing patient-reported frequency, severity, and interference of symptomatic adverse events (including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucositis), complementing clinician-graded CTCAE and facilitating earlier intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s8_4"><title>Pathology reporting, terminologies, and data standards</title><p>From a safety perspective, pathology reports are critical evidence in adverse-event adjudication. Synoptic and structured reporting—long promoted by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) to ensure completeness and clarity—helps clinicians and pharmacovigilance teams link histopathologic patterns to suspect therapies (e.g., “ischemic-type colitis compatible with VEGF-pathway inhibition”) and shortens time to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>]. Using standard terminologies strengthens interoperability: the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is the international regulatory vocabulary used by FDA and industry for coding adverse events and aligns with CTCAE terms and grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. At the EHR level, adoption of HL7 FHIR-based oncology profiles such as mCODE (Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) promotes consistent capture of treatment exposures, toxicities, and outcomes across systems, improving the quality of real-world safety data that feed institutional dashboards, registries, and, ultimately, national surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s8_5"><title>Practical implications for U.S. centers</title><p>Clinically, these national frameworks translate to several operational imperatives. First, institutions should maintain a simple, visible pathway for clinicians and pathology services to submit MedWatch reports when biopsy-proven or strongly suspected targeted-therapy GI injuries occur, ideally pre-populated with medication names, dates, and pathology descriptors. Second, endoscopy and pathology teams should document CTCAE grade (when feasible from clinical data) and use language that supports MedDRA coding. Third, oncology programs offering TKIs, ADCs, or CAR-T should keep living protocols synchronized with label updates and regulatory changes, such as the 2025 CAR-T REMS elimination, so that order sets, checklists, and escalation pathways remain current. Finally, building interoperable data flows (e.g., mCODE-conformant exports) facilitates local safety learning and contributes to national post-marketing knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9"><title>RESEARCH GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title><p>Despite the expanding body of evidence on gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities from non–immune checkpoint targeted therapies, several important gaps persist. Addressing these unmet needs will not only improve patient safety but also advance the integration of pathology into national oncology care.</p><sec id="s9_1"><title>Limited clinicopathologic correlation</title><p>Most clinical trials and FDA labels report rates of GI adverse events based on patient symptoms and laboratory findings but rarely include systematic histopathology data. Consequently, the spectrum of microscopic injury patterns apoptotic enteropathy, ischemic-type changes, and ulcerative colitis-like lesions remains under-characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>]. Future multi-institutional registries that link biopsy material with treatment exposure, CTCAE grade, and clinical outcome would strengthen diagnostic accuracy and guide tailored interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s9_2"><title>Underreporting in pharmacovigilance systems and integration of patient-reported outcomes and digital health</title><p>Spontaneous reporting to FAERS captures only a fraction of actual events. Even biopsy-confirmed drug-related toxicities are often not submitted, creating a blind spot for regulators and industry. Developing automated or semi-automated pipelines that extract structured toxicity data (e.g., MedDRA-coded pathology reports) into pharmacovigilance systems could enhance real-world signal detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>]. While the NCI’s PRO-CTCAE framework allows structured capture of GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, adoption is inconsistent outside clinical trials. Integrating PRO-CTCAE items into routine EHR workflows and linking them with pathology findings could accelerate recognition of evolving toxicities. Mobile health applications with real-time symptom reporting offer another avenue for early intervention and should be tested in populations on high-risk agents like ADCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s9_3"><title>Microbiome and host genetic susceptibility and comparative effectiveness of management strategies</title><p>Preclinical and translational studies suggest that the gut microbiome influences toxicity risk from TKIs and immunotherapies, but robust data in ADCs and CAR-T therapies are lacking. Similarly, host genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and DNA-repair pathways may modulate GI toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>]. Large-scale, prospective cohorts integrating multi-omics with clinical phenotyping could identify predictive biomarkers of toxicity.</p><p>Evidence comparing different management strategies for gastrointestinal toxicity from targeted therapies remains limited, but several themes have emerged. Corticosteroid-based approaches are effective for inflammatory or immune-mediated injury patterns most notably those associated with CAR-T therapies and bispecific antibodies, where cytokine-driven colitis often responds rapidly to systemic steroids and IL-6 pathway blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. In contrast, GI toxicities from TKIs, VEGF-pathway inhibitors, and ADCs are frequently non-immune in mechanism, and steroid therapy offers little benefit; management instead relies on supportive care, dose interruption, or permanent discontinuation in cases of ischemic injury or perforation risk. Limited comparative data suggest that nonsteroid strategies such as aggressive hydration, antimotility agents, bile acid sequestrants, and octreotide may be more effective in TKI- or ADC-associated diarrhea, whereas steroid exposure may delay mucosal regeneration in apoptosis-predominant injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>]. However, standardized trials comparing steroid versus nonsteroid approaches are lacking, and current practice is guided largely by mechanistic rationale, small case series, and extrapolation from ICI-related colitis literature. This highlights a significant evidence gap, underscoring the need for prospective, class-specific studies to inform optimal management algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s9_4"><title>Policy and real-world implementation science</title><p>The removal of REMS requirements for CAR-T therapies in 2025 illustrates how regulatory frameworks evolve with emerging safety data.
