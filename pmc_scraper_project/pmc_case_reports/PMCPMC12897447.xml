<bold>Core Tip:</bold> Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin commonly used to treat various bacterial infections. It is safe and generally well-tolerated. While frequently associated with adverse effects such as neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, cases of hepatotoxicity are rare. Prompt cessation of the medication is the primary approach in management.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) commonly occurs in the hospital setting with several classes of medication. The approximate annual incidence of DILI in the general public is 15-20 per 100000 in the United States and globally[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, because it is frequently underreported, it is challenging to verify its true incidence. Over 25% of DILI cases are caused by antibiotic-associated liver injury, which is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cephalosporins account for about 1% of DILI cases in prospective trials, despite the fact that they are often well-tolerated and linked to few adverse drug responses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Hospital settings employ cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, for a number of bacterial illnesses, such as intra-abdominal infections, pneumonias, urinary tract infections, and febrile neutropenia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although commonly associated with neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, it is rarely linked to liver injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fact, cefepime-induced liver toxicity is a rare adverse reaction to the drug that is infrequently seen by providers. A literature review unmasked only five reported cases of cefepime-induced liver injury, including a prospective study, a retrospective study, and three case reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We present a rare case of cefepime-induced liver injury that resolved with medication cessation. Prompt recognition of this adverse drug reaction can prevent fulminant liver failure and the development of chronic liver disease.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE PRESENTATION</title><sec><title>Chief complaints</title><p>Cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>History of present illness</title><p>A 73-year-old male arrived to the emergency department (ED) due to a 1-week history of shortness of breath, cough with greenish sputum, and worsening fatigue. The patient was seen by his pulmonologist for a routine visit, who subsequently recommended ED evaluation for his symptoms. On arrival to the ED, vital signs were within normal limits.</p></sec><sec><title>History of past illness</title><p>His medical history included hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atopic dermatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bronchiectasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Personal and family history</title><p>No personal or family history.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical examination</title><p>Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing, cachectic man in mild distress who responded to questions adequately. S1 and S2 heart sounds were present with normal rate and rhythm. Lung auscultation revealed coarse referred airway sounds throughout the bilateral lung fields, more greatly appreciated on the right. The abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, and extremities were symmetric without edema.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory examinations</title><p>Laboratory tests in the ED revealed leukocytosis (white blood cells 11.9/mm<sup>3</sup>), hypoglycemia (72), hyponatremia (129 mmol/L), hyperbilirubinemia (1.8 mg/dL), and elevated procalcitonin (1.395 ng/mL). All other values, such as coagulation profile, blood gas, creatinine clearance, and liver function tests (LFTs) [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 45 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 24 U/L] were within normal limits. A respiratory pathogen panel detected rhinovirus and methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were present in the nares. Blood cultures were negative.

Although the medication has been linked to incidences of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, DILI is uncommon[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A precise diagnosis of DILI necessitates a thorough review, including detailed laboratory and history data. This procedure includes noting the date of symptom development, measuring the pace of resolution following medication discontinuation, comparing clinical features to documented patterns associated with the culprit drug, and ruling out other potential causes of liver damage. Acute viral hepatitis should always be considered as a differential diagnosis and should be ruled out with serological hepatitis A, B, C, and E testing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Ischemia and viral illnesses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), should also be tested for and excluded as possible causes. Based on the R value, which uses the ratio of serum ALT to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), DILI can be categorized as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this case, the R value was 2.2 (257/114) with elevated serum ALP indicating a mixed pattern of hepatic injury. There have been previously documented cases of acute hepatotoxicity following cefepime therapy, including Liao <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], who reported on a similar scenario in which liver enzymes normalized within a few days.</p><p>Our patient in this case developed hepatic injury as noted above within 24 hours of starting cefepime therapy (2 g every 8 hours). The causal relationship between cefepime and DILI was assessed using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This accountability scale encompasses various criteria, including the time link between drug exposure and the onset of liver damage, the progression of liver enzymes after discontinuation of the drug, prior case documentation of DILI, concurrent medications, and other potential causes that might have led to the reaction. In our case, the Naranjo score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) was 7 on a scale of 0 to 12, with a score of ≥ 9 indicating that the drug was the likely cause of the reaction. The score of 7 correlated with the probable category. Some questions on the probability scale, such as “Was the drug detected in any body fluid in toxic concentrations”? were not feasible to answer, which partially accounted for the observed lower score. Other causes of liver injury were ruled out. Testing for hepatitis A, B, and C with a hepatitis panel was negative. Additional serological testing included EBV, CMV, anti-smooth muscle, and anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies, all of which were negative. Other drugs as a culprit of liver injury were also ruled out, as the patient was not taking any medications that are commonly associated with liver injury. Vancomycin, which can occasionally cause hepatoxicity, was continued despite the cessation of cefepime, ruling it out as a confounding factor. Transaminitis ultimately improved with cessation of drug therapy, and LFTs went back to baseline.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale for the patient</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

It is likely due to an idiosyncratic event in which the drug molecule or its metabolites trigger an immune-mediated cascade that damages hepatocytes, leading to inflammation and bile flow obstruction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While there is no universal treatment protocol, the primary approach typically involves cessation of the medication and providing supportive care. The patient ultimately died from respiratory failure during the admission, which was unrelated to his liver injury.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, our case illustrates a rare but true hepatotoxicity associated with cefepime therapy. Although cefepime is usually well-tolerated, it can lead to DILI especially in older patients with comorbid conditions. This article underscores the importance of careful monitoring of liver enzymes in patients receiving cefepime therapy. Worsening LFTs typically occur prior to symptoms and prompt cessation of therapy is important in preventing the development of fulminant liver failure and chronic liver disease. Clinicians should be aware of this rare adverse effect and intervene with medication cessation when necessary.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
