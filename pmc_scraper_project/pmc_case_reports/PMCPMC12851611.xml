ENKTL commonly affects the nasal cavity and upper aerodigestive tract, with primary orbital involvement in the absence of nasal manifestations an exceedingly uncommon occurrence, with only a few cases reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The clinical presentations of orbital ENKTL are often nonspecific, and frequently mimic benign inflammatory conditions such as orbital cellulitis or idiopathic orbital inflammation, which can lead to delays in diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Accurate diagnosis requires histopathological examination and molecular characterization, which typically involves the demonstration of reactivity for markers such as CD3, CD56, and EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The prognosis for orbital ENKTL remains poor due to its rapid progression and limited responsiveness to standard chemotherapy regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Here, we report a case of primary orbital ENKTL in an 18-year-old male presenting at Cancer Diseases Hospital (CDH) in Lusaka, Zambia, in an effort to contribute to the limited body of literature on this rare condition, and highlight the importance of early recognition through molecular characterization of the tumor. Our case is unique in that the patient responded well to treatment, without disease progression or relapse, but instead died as a result of other complications during treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="case report"><title>Case Report</title><p>We report a rare case of ENKTL, nasal type, confined to the orbit in an 18-year-old African male. The patient presented to the eye hospital of the University Teaching Hospitals (UTH) in Zambia, with an 8-month history of a progressively swelling and painful right orbital mass associated with ipsilateral headache and complete vision loss in the affected eye. He was previously treated twice at a local clinic for orbital cellulitis, with antibiotics and corticosteroids but no significant improvement. He denied any systemic “B” symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. There was no history of trauma or family history of a similar condition.</p><p>On examination, the patient had a visibly enlarged right orbit with proptosis and no light perception in the right eye. The globe was displaced, and ocular movements were restricted. The left eye examination was unremarkable. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the head and orbits showed a well-defined soft tissue mass confined to the right orbit, displacing the globe anteriorly, clinically staged as IE. There was no evidence of bony erosion, sinus involvement, or intracranial extension (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). A bone marrow biopsy was done and showed no signs of malignancy. A PET-CT scan was not done as it is currently not available at our institution.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>CT scan of the orbits.

lymphoma (NK/T cell lymphoma) of the orbit remains an exceptionally rare and aggressive entity, with recent case series emphasizing its rapid progression and poor clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In our 18-year-old patient, the insidious onset of orbital swelling, pain, and vision loss initially misdiagnosed as cellulitis and treated with antibiotics and steroids without improvement mirrors a common pitfall in diagnosis described in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This indicates that any persistent orbital mass unresponsive to anti-microbials and anti-inflammatory therapy should prompt early surgical biopsy, histological evaluation, and molecular characterization including staining for CD3, CD56, and EBER, to prevent delays in diagnosis.</p><p>Unlike nasal-type ENKTL, orbital cases typically lack sinus involvement or mid facial necrosis, which may further obscure clinical suspicion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nonetheless, comprehensive imaging and histological evaluation are indispensable for accurate diagnosis, staging and guiding therapy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of our patient’s tumor specimen confirmed an EBER positive NK/T lymphoma, aligning with the pathognomonic profile established in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other plausible differential diagnoses for a unilateral orbital mass in the absence of trauma and refractory to anti-microbials such as in our patient may be inflammatory conditions and/or benign or malignant tumors including hemangioma, mucocele, lacrimal gland tumor, and secondary metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Standard chemotherapy regimens for advanced ENKTL have historically yielded unsatisfactory results, with conventional anthracycline-based protocols demonstrating limited efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A regimen containing dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pegaspargase has been more effective with regards to progression-free survival, overall survival, and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In early-stage disease, combining chemotherapy with radiotherapy has improved outcomes, with complete response rates around 77% and 2-year survival rate of 78% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite these more effective regimens, toxicity remains a major challenge. Our patient developed drug-induced liver injury with subsequent hepatorenal failure after three cycles of GDP, underscoring the delicate balance between therapeutic intensity and tolerability. A possible underlying cause of the hepatorenal failure could be secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis as two diagnostic markers of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis including lactate dehydrogenase and serum ferritin were highly elevated at time of the clinical deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our administered treatment did not contain asparaginase or its analogues as it was not available.</p><p>From a molecular standpoint, ENKTL is driven by EBV mediated oncogenesis, angio-destructive growth, activation of the JAK-STAT pathways, and mutations in the TP53, DDX3X, and BCOR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PD L1 expression has been observed in almost 80% of ENKTL tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which may explain the excellent responses to PD 1 inhibitors in relapsed or refractory cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other novel therapeutic approaches include autologous cytotoxic T-cells targeting EBV latent membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, in resource-limited settings like ours, access to advanced regimens and radiotherapy remains constrained, underscoring the critical need for early recognition and the optimization of currently available treatments, with close monitoring the development of drug-induced side effects.</p><p>In conclusion, orbital ENKTL should be suspected in any persistent, treatment-resistant orbital mass, even among young patients. Rapid histological diagnosis and molecular characterization are essential. Tumor excision plus adjuvant GDP regimen may be beneficial in the absence of more effective L asparaginase-based regimens with radiotherapy or other targeted therapies. However, adverse events may limit the use of such conventional drugs.</p><p>The CARE Checklist has been completed by the authors for this case report, attached as online supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="statement of ethics"><title>Statement of Ethics</title><p>This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (Ref ID No. 6254/2025) and the National Health Research Authority (NHRA-1926/06/02/25).
