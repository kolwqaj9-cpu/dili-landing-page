Clinically, it is indicated for managing progesterone-deficiency disorders (e.g. anovulatory bleeding and dysmenorrhea) and perimenopausal syndrome when combined with estrogen. In obstetrics, progesterone supplementation remains a cornerstone for treating threatened or recurrent miscarriage associated with luteal insufficiency. Although evidence supports its efficacy in reducing miscarriage risk in cases of recurrent pregnancy loss,<sup>

Adverse drug reactions associated with progesterone were comprehensively compiled, and all preferred terms (PTs) across system organ classes were carefully extracted. In this study, “progesterone” refers to the naturally occurring hormone and its pharmaceutical preparations. Reports explicitly mentioning synthetic progestins, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, were excluded during data cleaning to focus on the safety profile of progesterone. Progesterone was designated as the primary suspect drug (PS) in FAERS, allowing an in-depth examination of its association with AEs. FAERS accepts AE reports from various sources, including physicians, pharmacists, patients, pharmaceutical companies, and other healthcare professionals.<sup>

</sup> The FAERS dataset comprises seven distinct databases, including demographic and administrative information, adverse drug reaction data, drug details, therapy start and end dates, report sources, and indications for use or diagnoses. To improve data reliability, a deduplication process was applied: for records with matching case unique IDs (CASE_ID), the most recent FDA received date (FDA_DT) was retained. If both CASE_ID and FDA_DT were identical, the record with the highest reporting ID (PRIMARY_ID) was selected. Only cases in which progesterone was identified as the primary suspected drug were included in the analysis.</p><p>All data used in this study were derived from the publicly available FAERS database, in which patient details are deidentified by the FDA. Furthermore, no personal identifiers were accessed, processed, or reported in our analysis. The reporting of this study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.<sup>

Regarding age distribution, over half of the cases (54.73%) had unknown age information. The most commonly reported age group was 18–44 years (25.73%), followed by 45–64 years (15.33%). Females accounted for 78.82% of cases, while sex was unspecified in 21.18% of cases. Weight data were largely unavailable, representing 81.23% of cases; among known cases, 13.63% accounted for individuals weighing less than 73 kg. Outcomes showed that 40% of cases had unknown results, while 37.71% were categorized as “other outcomes.” Hospitalizations occurred in 14.67% of cases, and severe outcomes, including death (1.46%) and life-threatening events (2.28%), were less frequently reported. Over the 20-year study period, the highest number of reports was recorded in 2024 (21.13%), followed by a steady decrease in earlier years.

Several important findings emerged, providing valuable information for a deeper understanding of progesterone safety. The analysis also highlighted issues that warrant attention in clinical use.</p><p>Regarding trends in AE reporting, the number of progesterone-related AE reports has steadily increased in recent years, peaking in 2024. This rise may reflect heightened awareness and improved reporting practices among healthcare professionals and consumers. Enhanced pharmacovigilance systems and better education on reporting procedures likely contributed to more frequent and comprehensive documentation of AEs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-03000605261417447">21</xref>
</sup></p><p>In terms of report sources, consumers accounted for the largest proportion. This trend reflects growing patient awareness and engagement in drug safety. Recent efforts to encourage patient participation in pharmacovigilance, including initiatives promoting direct reporting in databases such as FAERS, have further supported this trend.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-03000605261417447">22</xref>
</sup> The increasing availability of online platforms and mobile health applications has also facilitated consumer reporting, leading to a higher number of submissions by nonprofessionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-03000605261417447">23</xref>
</sup> A significant proportion of reports originated from countries such as the United States, Canada, and Germany, reflecting the robust pharmacovigilance systems and proactive monitoring mechanisms in these regions. Healthcare professionals in these countries are generally more aware of the importance of AE reporting, contributing to higher reporting rates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-03000605261417447">24</xref>
</sup></p><p>The study also found that progesterone-related AEs predominantly occurred in female patients and were concentrated in the 18–44 years age group. This pattern is closely related to the primary use of progesterone in the treatment of reproductive health–related conditions. Women in this age group use progesterone more frequently for reasons such as irregular menstruation, luteal support in assisted reproductive technology, and prevention of habitual miscarriage, making them more likely to be exposed to progesterone-related risks. These findings suggest that clinicians should carefully assess the risks and benefits when prescribing progesterone for this population.</p><p>Regarding the timing of AEs, most occurred within 6 months of exposure, with the 30–180 day period being the most common. This may reflect the body’s adaptation to hormonal changes induced by progesterone. As a hormone, progesterone affects the endocrine system upon administration, and the body requires time to adjust to these changes. During this adaptation period, various AEs may occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-03000605261417447">25</xref>
</sup> Although life-threatening and fatal AEs are relatively rare, their severity warrants careful attention. Clinicians should maintain high vigilance and strengthen patient monitoring and management.</p><p>Consistent with previous findings, this study observed common side effects of progesterone use, such as headache, dizziness, and nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-03000605261417447">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-03000605261417447">27</xref></sup> From 2004 Q1 to 2024 Q3, frequently reported AEs primarily involved injury, poisoning, general and site-related disorders, and gastrointestinal problems. Progesterone can interact with other drugs, potentially causing abnormal metabolism or toxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-03000605261417447">28</xref>
</sup> Overdose may result in symptoms such as dizziness and, in severe cases, confusion or hypotension. Progesterone injections can cause injection-site inflammation or infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-03000605261417447">29</xref>
</sup> Its smooth-muscle relaxing effect may delay gastric emptying, leading to bloating and indigestion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-03000605261417447">30</xref>
</sup> Long-term oral use may result in cholestatic reactions and right upper abdominal pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-03000605261417447">31</xref>
</sup></p><p>Our study also identified several novel progesterone-related AEs, including acute eosinophilic pneumonia and meningioma, as well as rare but high signal-strength events, including chronic nodular chondrodermatitis of the helix, autoimmune dermatitis, and malignant nervous system tumors. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into their underlying mechanisms. Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of lung tissue and can be triggered by drugs through immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-03000605261417447">32</xref>
</sup> Progesterone, as a steroid hormone, has been implicated in modulating immune responses, potentially shifting the balance toward Th2-mediated hypersensitivity pathways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-03000605261417447">33</xref>
</sup> The high signal strength indicates an idiosyncratic reaction linked to genetic or epigenetic predispositions, such as polymorphisms in cytokine or eosinophil regulatory genes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-03000605261417447">34</xref>
</sup> Meningiomas are primarily associated with genetic mutations or hormonal influences. Progesterone receptors (PR) are frequently expressed in meningioma tissues, suggesting that progesterone may promote tumor growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-03000605261417447">35</xref>
</sup> Prior studies have shown that high levels of exogenous progesterone can enhance the proliferation of meningioma cells in vitro, particularly in hormone-sensitive tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-03000605261417447">5</xref>
</sup> Although causality remains speculative, these findings may explain the observed association and warrant further investigation. Autoimmune dermatitis may result from progesterone’s immune-modulating effects, as the hormone can influence regulatory T cell function and cytokine profiles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-03000605261417447">33</xref>
</sup> Dysregulated immune homeostasis can lead to loss of self-tolerance, precipitating autoimmune skin reactions. This is consistent with reports of progesterone exacerbating autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, through interactions with estrogen receptors and immune pathways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-03000605261417447">36</xref>
</sup></p><p>Given these findings, clinicians should pay close attention to these rare but serious AEs, particularly in high-risk populations such as patients with comorbid autoimmune diseases or a history of allergies. Prior to treatment, risk stratification should be conducted through baseline assessments, including eosinophil counts and imaging examinations, along with individualized risk–benefit evaluations. During treatment, structured monitoring within the first 6 months is critical, as 43% of AEs occur between 30 and 180 days after exposure. Symptom checklists and targeted laboratory tests can facilitate timely detection of AEs, allowing appropriate interventions. Regulatory authorities should also consider updating progesterone product labels to clearly indicate potential risks associated with long-term and high-dose use of progesterone. Clinical guidelines should emphasize selecting appropriate administration methods according to the characteristics of different formulations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-03000605261417447">37</xref>
</sup></p><p>Although informative, this study has several limitations. The FAERS database relies on spontaneous reporting, which inevitably introduces reporting bias. Some AEs may remain unreported for various reasons, or there may be inaccurate reports. To mitigate reporting bias, healthcare professionals should receive regular training to enhance awareness of the importance of AE reporting. Additionally, more convenient electronic reporting systems, including digital and automated tools, could simplify the reporting process. Encouraging patients to directly report AEs through accessible online platforms or applications may further reduce the reporting gap. Data incompleteness is another limitation. Key information, such as patient age, sex, weight, outcomes, comorbidities, or concurrent medications that may influence AEs, is often missing. This hampers in-depth analysis of relationships between these factors and AEs and increases the difficulty of controlling for confounding factors. Future studies should aim to include complete key information or adopt prospective research methods for comprehensive data collection, thereby improving evidence quality and providing more reliable guidance for clinical decision-making. Due to data constraints, this study was unable to stratify or compare safety signals across different routes of progesterone administration (oral vs. vaginal vs. intramuscular). Different administration routes may lead to varying systemic exposure levels and thus divergent adverse-event profiles; the absence of such information is an additional limitation. Moreover, this study could not distinguish the effects of different progesterone formulations, doses, or treatment durations on the occurrence and severity of AEs. Although major synthetic progestins were excluded, FAERS records often lack detailed information on drug subtypes, such as micronization processes or excipient composition, which may further impede precise interpretation of our findings. Given the diversity of progesterone formulations and regimens, future research should focus on collecting more detailed data to clarify the safety characteristics of different formulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec13-03000605261417447" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pharmacovigilance study identified significant signals for both known and potentially novel AEs associated with progesterone, including rare but strongly associated reactions.

The inherent limitations of spontaneous reporting data should be considered when interpreting these results.</p></sec><sec id="sec133-03000605261417447" sec-type="supplementary-material" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-03000605261417447" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>sj-pdf-1-imr-10.1177_03000605261417447 - Supplemental material for Safety profile of progesterone: Insights from an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)–based pharmacovigilance study</title></caption><media orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="sj-pdf-1-imr-10.1177_03000605261417447.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-imr-10.1177_03000605261417447 for Safety profile of progesterone: Insights from an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)–based pharmacovigilance study by Ren Xu, Xiaona Wang, Junqin Zhang, Yanan Ren, Luyang Su, Lu Sang and Jianzhi Su in Journal of International Medical Research</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Jianzhi Su <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0414-6391" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://orcid.org/0009-0006-0414-6391</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><sec id="sec18-03000605261417447"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>Ren Xu contributed to the conception and design of the study, data analysis, and interpretation of the results.</p><p>Xiaona Wang assisted with data analysis and manuscript preparation.</p><p>Junqin Zhang contributed to data collection and provided critical revisions to the manuscript.</p><p>Luyang Su performed statistical analyses and reviewed the manuscript.</p><p>Yanan Ren contributed to the study design and critical revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Lu Sang contributed to the interpretation of the results and manuscript editing.</p><p>Jianzhi Su supervised the study, provided overall guidance, and reviewed the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec16-03000605261417447" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data used in this study are publicly available through FAERS and can be accessed via the FDA’s official website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.fda.gov/</ext-link>).
