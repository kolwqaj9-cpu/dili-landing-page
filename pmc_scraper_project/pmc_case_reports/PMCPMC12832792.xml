Hepatobiliary disorders exhibited the strongest signal strength (ROR = 2.66, 95% CI: 2.50–2.83), with hepatic failure and fulminant hepatitis identified as high-priority AEs. The majority of AEs occurred within 30 days of treatment initiation. Subgroup analysis indicated that elderly patients (≥65 years) and males had higher risks of liver failure, whereas higher body weight appeared protective. Network analysis identified 63 overlapping targets, with MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways significantly enriched.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pharmacovigilance analysis identifies regorafenib-associated hepatotoxicity as a significant safety signal, with higher risks observed in elderly and male patients.

Specifically, it inhibits a spectrum of receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3), TIE2 (a critical regulator of angiogenesis), KIT, RAF1, RET, BRAF (V600E mutant), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tsai et al., 2021</xref>). Regorafenib was initially approved for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and later for hepatocellular carcinoma progressing after sorafenib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bruix et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Ciracì et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dedousis et al., 2025</xref>). Furthermore, regorafenib is under active investigation for treating various solid tumors, including cholangiocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Demols et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Han et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Toulmonde et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Regorafenib has been extensively employed in clinical practice and demonstrated efficacy. Given its widespread clinical use, evaluating the real-world safety profile of regorafenib is critically important. Current data on regorafenib-associated adverse events predominantly derive from short-term clinical trials; however, these studies typically enroll specific patient populations under strict inclusion criteria with limited sample sizes, thus limiting comprehensive assessment of the drug’s adverse reactions. The prescribing information indicates that the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) associated with regorafenib include pain, hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, and diarrhea. Of particular concern is regorafenib-induced severe hepatotoxicity, for which the FDA has issued a black box warning. Severe toxic hepatitis occurred in some patients receiving regorafenib, and a significant proportion developed acute liver failure during treatment.</p><p>The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a publicly accessible database comprising extensive records of adverse drug reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Alatawi and Hansen, 2017</xref>). As the largest global pharmacovigilance database, it serves as a valuable resource for identifying drug-related adverse events. To further evaluate the real-world safety profile of regorafenib, we aim to analyze regorafenib-associated AEs documented within FAERS, thereby providing supplementary evidence to inform clinical practice. Understanding the intrinsic biological mechanisms underlying regorafenib-induced liver failure is critical for risk prediction, early diagnosis, and the development of preventive strategies. However, this mechanism remains elusive. Network pharmacology, an emerging bioinformatics methodology, enables systematic elucidation of drug toxicity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, network pharmacology approaches were employed to predict and identify key molecular targets and signaling pathways potentially mediated by regorafenib in liver failure, and to preliminarily elucidate its potential molecular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><label>2.1</label><title>Data sources and processing</title><p>This study extracted AE reports associated with regorafenib (including its trade name, STIVARGA) from the FAERS database, covering the period from the third quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2025. Reports were included only if regorafenib was designated as the primary suspect (PS) drug. Data extraction and cleansing were performed using R software (version 4.4.3). The initial database comprised 19,092,746 reports. Reports were deemed duplicates if they shared identical key identifiers, including the patient’s unique identifier (when available), the date of the AE, the reported drug, and the description of the AE. When multiple reports involved the same patient and drug-related AE, only the most recent entry was retained. This approach ensured that each unique AE instance was counted only once, thereby reducing the potential over-representation of specific events in the analysis. After deduplication, 16,426,538 unique drug-related reports remained for subsequent analysis. The dataset encompassed demographic information, concomitant drugs, indications, reported adverse reactions, and patient outcomes. For demographic variables such as sex, age, and body weight, missing data were retained and reported as distinct categories in the descriptive clinical characteristics analysis. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 27.0) at the Preferred Term (PT) level. Subsequently, PTs were categorized according to their respective System Organ Classes (SOCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><label>2.2</label><title>Data mining</title><p>To assess significant associations between regorafenib and AEs, we utilized multiple pharmacovigilance methodologies: specifically, the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN). The integration of these diverse methods is crucial for robust signal detection, as each offers unique strengths. ROR and PRR are traditional frequentist methods, effective for identifying common signals and easy to interpret. In contrast, the Bayesian methodologies (MGPS, BCPNN) are more robust for identifying rare safety signals and less susceptible to data sparsity, thus providing greater stability and reliability. The Bayesian methodologies (MGPS, BCPNN) demonstrated enhanced robustness in identifying rare safety signals. The Bayesian methodologies (MGPS, BCPNN) demonstrated enhanced robustness in identifying rare safety signals. To minimize the detection of false positive signals, potential signals were defined as AEs exceeding the positivity threshold in at least one of these methodologies. This inclusive approach ensures comprehensive signal capture, leveraging the strengths of each method to identify any disproportionately reported AE. The two-by-two contingency table and detailed formulas for these methods of disproportionality analysis and the widely accepted positive signal thresholds are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s11">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><label>2.3</label><title>Clinical prioritization evaluation</title><p>The primary objective of clinical priority assessment is to identify signals indicative of significant risks to patient or public health, or those with the potential to substantially alter the risk-benefit profile of a medicinal product, thereby necessitating urgent mitigation. A semi-quantitative assessment of emerging signals within the PT tier was conducted, evaluating each signal across four key dimensions: adherence to Important Medical Event (IME) or Designated Medical Event (DME) criteria, reporting rate, signal stability, and reported case fatality rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). IMEs (serious events—version 26.0) and DMEs (rare but serious events with a high likelihood of drug causation) are established and standardized definitions issued by the European Medicines Agency. Each dimension was stratified into three levels, assigned scores of 0, 1, or 2 respectively. AEs were subsequently categorized as low, moderate, or high clinical priority based on cumulative scores falling within the ranges of 0–2, 3–5, or 6–8, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cecco et al., 2024</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Criteria and relevant scores to prioritize AEs emerged from disproportionality analysis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Criterium</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 points</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 point</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0 point</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reporting rate (cases/non-cases)</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&gt;10%</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1%–10%</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0%–1%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Signal stability (consistency across disproportionality analyses)</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 of 3</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 of 3</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 of 3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reported case fatality rate (proportion of reports with death as outcome)</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&gt;50%</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">25%–50%</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt;25%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">DMEs or IMEs</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">DME</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">IME</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">None</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>AEs, adverse events; DME, designated medical event; IME, important medical event.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><label>2.4</label><title>Time-to-onset analysis</title><p>The time-to-onset (TTO) of an AE was defined as the interval between the start date of regorafenib treatment and the reported AE onset date. Only reports with complete information on both the start date of regorafenib treatment and the AE onset date were included to ensure accurate calculation of TTO, leading to the exclusion of cases with missing onset dates. Onset times were summarized using median values and interquartile ranges (IQR). Temporal patterns in AE incidence were examined using Weibull distribution analysis. The Weibull distribution is characterized by two parameters: scale (α) and shape (β). The shape parameter (β) of the Weibull distribution characterizes the underlying hazard function for AE occurrence over time: If β &lt; 1, the AE is mainly concentrated in the early stage of administration of the medication (early failure-type profile); if β = 1, the AE occurs randomly with no obvious time aggregation (random failure-type profile); and β &gt; 1 is thought to indicate an increase with time (wear-out failure-type profile) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Sauzet and Cornelius, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, cumulative AE incidences were visualized using Kaplan-Meier curves, with between-group comparisons performed using the log-rank test. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed in R software (version 4.2.3; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><label>2.5</label><title>Network toxicological analysis</title><p>In this study, predicted targets of regorafenib were obtained from the STITCH and ChEMBL databases. Relevant targets of key AEs were collected from the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Subsequently, a Venn diagram was utilized to identify the intersection between the regorafenib-predicted targets and the AE-associated targets; these overlapping targets were defined as the candidate toxicity targets associated with regorafenib-induced AEs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for these putative toxicity targets was constructed using the STRING database. For the identification of core targets, network topology analysis was performed, with degree centrality as the primary evaluation indicator. The screening criterion for core targets was defined by selecting the top 10 nodes with the highest degree centrality scores within this PPI network, as these represent the most highly connected nodes and key regulatory hubs. The PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape software (version 3.8.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>). Key targets within this network were subsequently identified based on degree. Gene ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of potential toxicity targets for key AEs were performed using the DAVID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Sherman et al., 2022</xref>) and visualized using the bioinformatics online platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><label>2.6</label><title>Molecular docking</title><p>Molecular docking was utilized to further elucidate the intermolecular interactions between regorafenib and the key target proteins previously identified in this study, by predicting their binding modes and affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Paggi et al., 2024</xref>). The X-ray crystal structures of the key proteins were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org</ext-link>).

Target protein structures were prepared using PyMOL (version 4.6.0) by removing water molecules and co-crystallized ligands, followed by addition of hydrogen atoms, assignment of atomic charges, and merging of non-polar hydrogens using AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.6). Molecular docking proceeded with AutoDock Vina after sizing the Grid Box and genetic algorithm. The grid box was centered to cover the entire protein structure to cover the binding pocket.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the annual number of reports increased rapidly following market entry, peaked in 2018 (n = 1,007), and subsequently exhibited fluctuations, followed by a continuous downward trend. Of these, AE reports from males accounted for 54.67%, significantly higher than those from females at 38.02%. Regarding age distribution, patients aged 18–65 years accounted for the majority of reports (n = 3,841, 40.68%), followed closely by those in the 65–85 years age group (n = 3,382, 35.16%). The principal source of reports was the United States (n = 4,682,49.59%), and physicians were the most common reporters (n = 3,040, 32.20%). Among the reported outcomes, hospitalization (n = 2,716, 28.77%) was the most common severe outcome. Colorectal cancer is the most common indication (n = 5,880,62.27%), followed by hepatic cancer (n = 957,10.14%) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 578,6.12%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of AEs of regorafenib from the third quarter of 2012 (2012 Q3) to the first quarter of 2025 (2025 Q1).

While these studies established a baseline safety profile, they often lack the statistical power to comprehensively characterize rare, severe outcomes. This study advances the current understanding of regorafenib hepatotoxicity by leveraging a significantly larger sample size compared to prior works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Sakaeda et al., 2013</xref>). By utilizing this extensive real-world dataset, we were able to perform a robust multivariate analysis that identified higher body weight as a critical protective factor against liver failure—a nuance likely missed in smaller studies. Furthermore, we integrated this large-scale data mining with network toxicology and molecular docking, providing a unique translational link between statistical signals and their potential molecular drivers, specifically the dysregulation of MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways.</p><p>We observed that regorafenib-related AE reports peaked in 2018 (n = 1,007) and subsequently declined. We speculate that this change may be related to the approval of the new-generation multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is also one of the main indications for regorafenib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Al-Salama et al., 2019</xref>).

Based on the information from the baseline profile, it was observed that the AEs of regorafenib occurred more commonly in males (54.67%) than in females (38.02%), due to the epidemiologic factors for major indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Alvarez et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Murphy and Zaki, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Singal et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our results confirm that regorafenib is associated with a spectrum of AEs predominantly affecting Hepatobiliary Disorders, Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders, and Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl Cysts and Polyps) at the SOC level. Notably, Hepatobiliary Disorders emerged as the strongest signal, aligning with prior clinical trials such as the RESORCE ans CORRECT study, where liver-related toxicities were prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Finn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Grothey et al., 2013</xref>). This underscores the regorafenib’s hepatotoxic potential, with hepatic failure and fulminant hepatitis identified as high-priority designated medical events (DMEs), scoring maximally in our semi-quantitative clinical prioritization framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). The mechanism of regorafenib-induced acute liver injury remains unclear. Previous studies have suggested that TKI hepatotoxicity is related to the effects of their metabolites on hepatic cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Teng et al., 2010</xref>). Some scholars have also proposed that liver injury may result from drug-induced hepatic blood flow impairment or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Akamine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). A case report described regorafenib-associated autoimmune hepatitis that resolved after administration of azathioprine and prednisolone, suggesting a potential autoimmune mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Kuwayama et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPES), or hand-foot syndrome (HFS), is a common, dose-dependent toxicity associated with regorafenib and represents the costliest cutaneous adverse event to manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Borovicka et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike chemotherapy-induced skin damage, multikinase inhibitor-related PPES predominantly affects pressure-bearing areas (palmar and plantar regions) rather than dorsal surfaces and is typically more localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Robert et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with prior reports, regorafenib-associated PPES frequently manifests early in therapy (median onset: 15 days), contrasting with the later onset (median: 72–79 days) observed with capecitabine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Azad et al., 2009</xref>). While the precise mechanism underlying this toxicity remains incompletely understood, it is hypothesized that regorafenib may disrupt the natural balance between vascular and epidermal injury and repair through effects on multiple molecular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Azad et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, PPES development correlates with prolonged overall and progression-free survival in patients receiving other multikinase inhibitors, suggesting a potential association with treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Uekusa et al., 2024</xref>). While rarely life-threatening, the high incidence of regorafenib-induced PPES in clinical practice necessitates prompt recognition and management.</p><p>Comparative analysis with existing literature reveals both consistencies and novel insights. For instance, common AEs like PPES, fatigue, and decreased appetite were prevalent across age groups, corroborating phase III trials where PPES affected up to 47% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Grothey et al., 2013</xref>). However, our disproportionality analysis highlighted gender-specific differences: females showed stronger associations with mucosal inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation, while males were more prone to PPES and dysphonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). This sexual dimorphism may stem from pharmacokinetic variations, such as differences in drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes, where females often exhibit higher plasma levels due to lower body weight and hormonal influences. Furthermore, body composition differences are statistically relevant; females generally have a higher percentage of body fat. Since regorafenib is a lipophilic drug with a large volume of distribution, gender-specific differences in adipose tissue distribution may alter drug accumulation and elimination half-lives. Age-related disparities were also evident; elderly patients (≥65 years) had a shorter median TTO (14 days) and higher odds of target PTs, possibly due to reduced hepatic reserve and polypharmacy. These subgroup analyses extend beyond previous reports, which often overlooked weight as a factor; our logistic regression revealed that higher body weight (&gt;80 kg) significantly reduced the reporting odds of hepatic PTs, likely attributable to dose-independent pharmacokinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Keunecke et al., 2020</xref>). Clinically, since regorafenib is administered at a fixed dose (160 mg) rather than weight-based dosing, patients with higher body weight have lower systemic exposure (AUC) per kilogram compared to lighter patients. This suggests that the standard fixed dose may lead to supratherapeutic concentrations in patients with low body weight (&lt;50 kg), warranting consideration for dose reduction in this specific subgroup. This suggests that implementing individualized dose adjustments based on weight and gender in clinical practice may effectively reduce the risk of toxicity.</p><p>The temporal profile of AEs, characterized by an early failure type in Weibull distribution (β upper 95% CI &lt; 1), indicates that most events (66.58% within 30 days) occur shortly after initiation, consistent with regorafenib’s rapid onset of kinase inhibition. This pattern implies a need for intensive monitoring in the first month, particularly for high-priority signals like hepatic failure, which carried a case fatality rate warranting urgent intervention. Based on these findings, we propose a risk-adapted monitoring strategy. While standard labeling suggests monitoring liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) every two weeks during the first two months, our data supports a more aggressive approach for high-risk populations identified in this study—specifically males and elderly patients (≥65 years). For these groups, we recommend weekly liver function monitoring during the first cycle (28 days) to ensure early detection of hepatotoxicity before it progresses to irreversible failure. Prompt recognition during this critical 30-day window allows for timely dose interruption or reduction, which is vital given the rapid onset of kinase inhibition.</p><p>To uncover the molecular mechanisms, we employed network toxicology and identified 63 candidate targets bridging regorafenib and liver failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This overlap underscores the polypharmacological nature of regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, which may inadvertently disrupt hepatic homeostasis through off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Kabir and Muth, 2022</xref>).</p><p>To further delineate interactions among these targets, a PPI network was constructed. Topology analysis highlighted 10 core targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) serving as pivotal regulatory hubs in the pathogenesis of liver failure. These core targets, including key signaling nodes, highlight regorafenib’s interference with interconnected protein modules that govern cellular responses to stress, proliferation, and apoptosis in hepatocytes.</p><p>PPI network analysis identified the main targets of liver failure in the treatment of regorafenib; the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation results also exhibited good binding affinity and stability. Although this study lacks direct experimental validation, these findings are consistent with the known pharmacological profile of regorafenib. Besides, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that MAPK and PI3K-AKT signal pathways were significantly enriched. Existing studies have demonstrated that excessive activation of the MAPK pathway can exacerbate liver failure, whereas physiological levels of activation promote liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Ni et al., 2024</xref>). Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway exerts a protective effect on hepatocytes, significantly reducing markers of liver injury and cell death while mitigating oxidative damage in the context of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Shamsan et al., 2024</xref>). As a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib can inhibit the activation of these two pathways through direct or indirect mechanisms, thereby enhancing its anti-tumor effects while potentially promoting liver failure. Meanwhile, the MAPK pathway can negatively regulate the PI3K-Akt pathway in hepatocytes, and dual targeting of these pathways (e.g., inhibiting MAPK while activating PI3K-Akt) is regarded as a promising therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gan et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, while our molecular docking results confirm a strong binding affinity between regorafenib and these targets, future <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies are warranted to definitively verify whether the blockade of MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling is the direct cause of the observed hepatic failure.</p><p>This study also has some shortcomings and limitations: (1) As a spontaneous reporting system, FAERS may suffer from omissions, duplications, incomplete reports, and misreporting, which can introduce various forms of reporting bias (e.g., under-reporting, over-reporting, confounding by indication) due to the varying knowledge backgrounds of reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Alomar et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the signal strengths (ROR/PRR) represent statistical associations within the database, not absolute clinical risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Xia et al., 2023</xref>). (2) While we utilized multivariable logistic regression to control for demographic factors (age, gender, weight), we could not account for unobserved confounders such as comorbidities, genetic susceptibility, and all concomitant medications due to incomplete data entries. Consequently, the identified factors should be interpreted as being associated with a higher likelihood of reporting, rather than confirmed independent risk factors for liver failure. Causality cannot be definitively established based solely on this retrospective analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Crisafulli et al., 2023</xref>). (3) In network toxicology, target prediction for regorafenib heavily relies on database algorithms. While molecular docking showed strong binding affinities and literature comparison supports the involvement of MAPK/PI3K-Akt pathways, these findings lack direct ‘wet-lab’ experimental validation (e.g., Western blot or PCR) in this study. Future <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments are necessary to confirm the precise regulatory roles of these targets in regorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Liao et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis of the FAERS database characterizes the real-world safety profile of regorafenib, highlighting severe liver injury as a priority safety signal that frequently occurs early in treatment. We identified male sex and advanced age as significant risk factors, whereas higher body weight appeared protective. Furthermore, network toxicology predictions suggest that the MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways may mediate these adverse effects. These findings underscore the importance of early hepatic function monitoring, particularly in high-risk populations, to mitigate drug-induced liver injury.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p>
