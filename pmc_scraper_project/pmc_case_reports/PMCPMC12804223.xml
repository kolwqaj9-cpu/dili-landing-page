In particular, guidance for evaluation of elevated liver tests due to COVID-19, its treatments, and COVID-19 vaccination is lacking. The IQ DILI Initiative, composed of experts from academia, regulatory agencies, and industry herein propose recommendations to address this gap. Extensive literature review was conducted and structured discussions were held between IQ DILI industry members, regulators, and academic experts in hepatology and DILI. Liver-related manifestations in nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 are highly varied. Evidence of liver injury may occur after COVID-19 symptoms resolve and testing is negative. Treatments for COVID-19 may cause liver injury or alter pharmacokinetics. COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with rare but clear hepatotoxicity, typically consistent with drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis, although other presentations, severity, latency, and time to resolution have been reported. Liver injury occurred with mRNA and viral vector vaccines, and in individuals with and without underlying autoimmune or liver diseases. Drug developers and investigators should be aware of the potential liver-related manifestations related to COVID-19, its treatments, and COVID-19 vaccination, as this may impact study eligibility and causality assessment during a trial. COVID-19 testing should be considered part of DILI causality assessment, as a positive test may prevent premature termination of the investigational drug. Since clinical trial participants may not consider vaccinations in their medical history, specific inquiry about their receipt is important when liver tests are abnormal during screening and as part of DILI causality assessment.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40264-025-01591-0.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="d33e295"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par2">

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded promptly with the release of several regulatory guidances on COVID-19, which contained recommendations for the conduct of clinical trials performed during the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The hepatology community rapidly compiled manuscripts on the manifestations of COVID-19-associated liver abnormalities and made recommendations on the management and treatment of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) during the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the USA, 11 May 2023 marked the end of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The initial challenges pertaining to the execution and performance of clinical trials due to the pandemic have largely been overcome and the liver-related manifestations occurring in acutely ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been defined and will not be addressed in this manuscript. However, COVID-19 remains an important public health issue with continual emergence of variants and high rates still being reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in many states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, long COVID-19, which is now a recognized clinical entity, can also be associated with liver abnormalities. As such, many questions remain and gaps exist as to the best practices to adopt in clinical trials specifically related to liver test abnormalities due to or associated with COVID-19, its treatment, and/or vaccination. These include how to assess and manage elevated liver tests, as liver disorders associated with COVID-19 may impact eligibility criteria and the assessment of liver test elevations occurring during the clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>IQ-DILI</title><p id="Par5">The IQ DILI Initiative was launched in June 2016 within the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (also known as the IQ consortium) to reach consensus and propose best practices on topics related to DILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The IQ Initiative is a science‐focused, not‐for‐profit organization addressing scientific and technical aspects of drug development and is composed of 44 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iqconsortium.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://iqconsortium.org/</ext-link>). The IQ DILI Initiative is an affiliate of the IQ Consortium, composed of 17 IQ member companies, focused on establishing best practices for diagnosing, monitoring, managing, and preventing DILI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods and Scope of this Manuscript</title><p id="Par6">To provide meaningful guidance to sponsors and investigators involved in clinical trials, members of the IQ DILI Initiative have developed a number of recommendations to address the lack of specific guidance on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination when designing eligibility criteria and when evaluating a new onset of elevated liver tests occurring during a clinical trial.</p><p id="Par7">This publication is based on an extensive literature review of PUBMED, Embase, and MEDLINE utilizing the keywords DILI, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccination, liver, and clinical trials. Consensus recommendations were achieved after numerous structured discussions between IQ DILI members and academic and regulatory experts. The levels of evidence and strength of each consensus statement have not been formally rated. These recommendations are based on the expert opinions of the authors and do not imply regulatory guidance or mandate.</p><p id="Par8">It is conceivable that future pandemics may have similar characteristics to COVID-19, and as such, many of the approaches suggested herein could serve as a precedent for assessing the impact of other similar emerging viruses as they relate to liver injury on trial eligibility and the detection and management of suspected DILI. However, it is important to underscore that while transient liver abnormalities can occur with any acute viral illness, individual liver-related virus-specific injury phenotypes may differ, and as such, impact best practices in their assessment and management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Liver Injury Due to SARS-CoV2 Infection</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mechanisms of Hepatotoxicity Due toSARS-CoV2 Infection</title><p id="Par9">While a full discussion of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-associated liver injury is beyond the scope of this manuscript and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], this section will summarize some leading theories (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 binds to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], after a priming step of the viral spike protein domain by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. ACE-2 receptors are expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and liver progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TMPRSS2 is also found on liver progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Autopsy studies have isolated SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens directly from the liver and bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. With these findings, one postulated mechanism of viral-induced liver injury has been direct SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic hepatotoxicity. Other factors causing and/or contributing to liver injury are indirect effects arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another well-described effect of the virus during acute infection is the induction of a massive systemic immune response or cytokine storm, driven by increased immune cell production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2R, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a cohort of 96 patients admitted to an Austrian hospital for COVID-19, biomarkers of systemic inflammation IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and/or ferritin correlated with the height of AST elevation (determined to be of liver origin), suggesting that the immune response to COVID-19 disease can cause or exacerbate liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) have been reported to occur later in the acute course of COVID-19 illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The reasons for these delayed effects were not explained. It is important to underscore that these data were obtained from hospitalized patients with severe infections and may not translate into the milder outpatient liver abnormalities that may be more applicable to patients enrolling in clinical trials. Other indirect factors that have been noted to lead to liver abnormalities include immune-mediated damage, anoxia, and reactivation of a preexisting chronic liver disease, e.g., autoimmune hepatitis or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].<fig id="Fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mechanisms of Liver Injury in COVID-19</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="40264_2025_1591_Fig1_HTML.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">Liver injury due to SARS-CoV-2 virus may occur due to direct effects of viral entry into hepatocytes mediated by ACE2 and subsequent activation of cell death and apoptosis. Alternate indirect mechanisms of injury can involve T-cell activation and downstream immune/vascular effects such as (1) activation of monocytes and macrophages resulting in a cytokine storm of inflammatory agents such as IL-6, IL-10, CRP; (2) inflammatory effects on neutrophils and vasculature leading to abnormal coagulation and ischemia reperfusion injury; and (3) reactivation of chronic viral hepatitis and subsequent hepatocyte death.

Most publications describing COVID-related liver manifestations occurred in acutely ill hospitalized patients with numerous comorbidities. Liver injury in these critically ill patients occurred in up to 67% of cases and was typically associated with numerous contributory or confounding factors such as sepsis, ischemia, multiple organ dysfunction, immune-mediated injury due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, direct hepatotoxicity of the virus, and the use of hepatotoxic medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This group of patients will not be discussed further in this manuscript as they would not be eligible for enrollment in a clinical trial of a study drug for a non-COVID-19 indication.</p><p id="Par13">Over the last few years, individual case reports and case series of liver injury associated with mild-to-moderate nonhospitalized patients who had COVID-19 have been described. Overall, up to 11% of patients with COVID-19 have liver comorbidities and 14–53% show elevated aminotransferase levels during illness progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Liver injury is mild, transient, and resolves without intervention in most cases. However, it is important to emphasize that such injury may impact clinical trial eligibility, and should be an essential component of causality assessment when investigational products are being assessed for DILI. Importantly, some cases have atypical presentations and thus do not fit the current broad definition of “COVID-19-associated liver injury.” Examples include liver test elevations without the occurrence of respiratory symptoms, liver test elevations after resolution of respiratory symptoms, and/or liver test elevations after the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As such, it is important for both investigators and sponsors to be aware of the diverse liver-injury phenotypes associated with COVID-19 that may occur during the clinical trials that are described below and summarized in (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>).

The second liver-related phenotype occurred in three children, two of 8 years of age and one of 13 years of age, who presented with hepatitis and cholestasis several months after a diagnosis of COVID-19. Two children had a liver biopsy that showed lymphocytic portal and parenchyma inflammation and with bile duct proliferations. All three children were started on steroid treatment with subsequent improvements of liver enzymes. All patients had an extensive causality assessment without an alternative etiology identified.

This often does not present a problem in the clinical trial setting since subjects with significant symptoms from intercurrent COVID-19 infection will likely have study drug paused or permanently discontinued. In cases in which it has been determined that the benefits of continued study participation outweigh the risks, liver tests should be monitored more frequently. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid<sup>TM</sup>) has been associated with aminotransferase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice. The package insert states that “caution should be exercised when administering Paxlovid<sup>TM</sup> to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities or hepatitis, especially those with advanced liver disease patients with Child-Pugh-C” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. While treatment with Paxlovid<sup>TM</sup> should not be withheld, it is important for investigators to be aware of this rare but possible cause of a new onset of liver abnormalities. Additionally, ritonavir is one of the most potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. The potential for drug–drug interactions must be considered in this setting, both for its potential impact on metabolism of the study drug and its metabolites, as well as its impact on other drugs used by the study participant.</p><p id="Par26">Other treatments for COVID-19 have also been implicated in liver injury.

Thus, it is not surprising that there are case series and case reports of SARS CoV-2 vaccine-associated liver injury (SVALI).

The exact mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced liver injury is not known. The most common types of COVID-19 vaccines in the USA contain mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The entry of S protein in the human body elicits a strong stimulus to innate immunity, which results in cellular activation, leading to proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production.

There was no difference in incidence of SVALI by vaccine type. The mechanisms and clinical presentation of SVALI associated with COVID-19 vaccination are summarized in Table 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Impact on DILI Assessment and Management during Clinical Trials</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>DILI in Clinical Trials in the Context of COVID-19 and COVID-19 Treatments</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Screening and Eligibility Criteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>)</title><p id="Par35">Patients with signs and symptoms of acute COVID-19 infection are routinely excluded from clinical trials for multiple reasons, including confounding trial results, protection of study participants and staff, and potential need to interrupt the study for the symptomatic participant due to progressive infection. Symptomatic individuals should be tested for SARS-CoV2 using an RT-PCR or viral antigen test and excluded from clinical trial participation until symptoms resolve. RT-PCR testing has been shown to have substantially greater sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV2 compared with rapid viral antigen testing (RAT), especially for strains related to Omicron SARS-CoV2 variants, and should be considered a preferred method for ruling out active viral infection in symptomatic individuals with negative RAT results unless the longer turnaround time makes this impractical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. A test of cure is not usually required since patients may have persistently positive tests for up to 90 days following initial infection but are not considered contagious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Isolation can generally be discontinued after 5 days for mild cases and 10 days for more severe cases provided the patient’s clinical condition is improving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Retesting is recommended using an antigen test or nucleic acid amplification test in the case of a moderately to severely immunocompromised patient. Utilization of serology tests is not useful for diagnosing acute infection since a large portion of the population has been vaccinated with vaccines containing spike protein, which will result in seroconversion for most common tests, regardless of acute infection. The screening of asymptomatic individuals prior to study entry is complicated by a lag between infection and viral detection. It should be noted that the mean incubation period after exposure ranges from approximately 5 to 9 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Antigen tests are less sensitive than nucleic acid tests, leading to false negative results, a potential delay in turnaround time (particularly for global trials), and the need for repeat testing that complicates the logistics and duration of the screening period. Additionally, given the relatively low prevalence of such infections in patients presenting for entry into clinical studies, COVID-19 antigen tests are not recommended. Another important consideration is the broad immune activation lasting approximately 4–6 weeks produced by both acute SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination (see section on vaccination). This may confound any study biomarkers intended to assess investigational product activity. Thus, unless the underlying clinical condition warrants urgent treatment with an investigational product, such as when treatment options have been exhausted, it is best to postpone participation in trials for several weeks to avoid confounding the interpretation of study results and drug relatedness assessments.</p><p id="Par36">Finally, it is important to be aware that COVID-19 may have long-term effects on drug metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>] .<fig id="Fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Algorithm for Screening for Suspected Liver Injury in Relation to COVID-19 Infection, Treatment, and Vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">SARS-CoV-2</italic> severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2</p></caption><graphic id="MO2" orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="40264_2025_1591_Fig2_HTML.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Detection, Monitoring, Causality Assessment, and Management of DILI</title><p id="Par37">Once enrolled in a clinical trial, a patient who becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be managed individually and continued administration of the investigational product should depend on considerations of the potential for the study drug to produce significant immunosuppression, which could impact resolution of COVID-19 and the potential impact of COVID-19 treatment on the trial intervention and patient safety. An individual benefit–risk assessment should be conducted by the investigator to determine whether to continue the investigational therapy. Factors to be considered include the urgency for treatment of the underlying condition and the impact of treatment interruptions, the half-life and pharmacodynamics of the investigational product, and the nature of the immune defect associated with the investigational product. Data should be collected and reported to the sponsor on comorbidities and risk factors, treatments administered, especially as some are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 as noted above, supplemental oxygen administration, and patient outcomes. This will allow a thorough assessment of the impact of the investigational product on study outcomes and to interpret missing data and/or confounding variables on outcomes and endpoint data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. When unexpected liver test elevations occur or worsen during the clinical trial, SARS-CoV2 testing using RT-PCR should be performed as a routine part of a second-line DILI causality assessment regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. To expedite the diagnosis, consideration should be given to local lab testing. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the population being studied and in the various study/site locations should be considered while determining the sequence of evaluating alternate etiologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>DILI in Clinical Trials in the Context of COVID-19 Vaccination</title><p id="Par38">While vaccinations for COVID-19 can produce an immune perturbation, the benefit–risk remains positive in favor of vaccination during most trials. Generally, the study duration does not justify delaying appropriate initial and booster vaccination. Vaccinations have, however, been reported to be associated with a low frequency of liver test elevations, which must be kept in mind during study observations. For studies of immunomodulatory agents, deferring study entry for approximately 1 month after completing the vaccine series is advisable when possible. This should permit the broad immune activation associated with COVID-19 vaccines to subside sufficiently to avoid interference with study endpoints and afford some level of protection against severe COVID-19. However, the deferral time for study entry should be customized for specific immuno-activating or suppressing treatments and patient populations and justified scientifically by a sponsor in the protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Consensus Recommendations for DILI in the Context of COVID-19, Its Treatment, and COVID-19 Vaccination during Clinical Trials</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Assessment at Screening</title><p id="Par39">

It is important that the specific COVID-19-related factors discussed herein be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with liver abnormalities during screening, as well as those with a new onset or worsening of liver tests occurring during the clinical trial. Sponsors and investigators need to be aware of the varied liver-related presentations of COVID-19, with emphasis on the fact that signs of liver injury can occur even in the absence of respiratory symptoms or weeks after a positive RT-PCR test and subsequent resolution of symptoms.</p><p id="Par59">Recommendations to delay or exclude patients or to remove a patient from the clinical trial apply only to specific situations and are dependent on the type of liver injury, the indications being studied, the treatments being assessed (e.g., immunomodulatory agents), and the individual benefit–risk assessment. While it is clear that COVID-19 can be associated with liver test abnormalities, clinical features of the course of COVID-19, including time to resolution, likelihood of progression to chronicity, magnitude of liver test elevation, and fluctuation over time, have not been clearly defined. This is a research gap that needs to be addressed. Better characterization of these factors will enhance causality assessment to differentiate the study drug from the infection and minimize premature study drug discontinuation.</p><p id="Par60">While SVALI is rare, many gaps remain in our knowledge. For example, it is unknown whether liver test elevations can occur after the fourth or fifth annual COVID shot. Answers to such questions can only become clear with time and further assessment. It should be underscored that there are multiple factors that should be considered when evaluating each individual patient in a clinical trial. As such, a more personalized approach to DILI evaluation will yield the best benefit–risk balance. In this manner, premature drug pauses or discontinuations may be avoided.</p><p id="Par61">Future pandemics may have similar characteristics to COVID-19, and as such, many of the approaches suggested herein may serve as a precedent for assessing the impact of another virus as it relates to liver injury on trial eligibility and DILI causality assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><media orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="40264_2025_1591_MOESM1_ESM.docx" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 417 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Melissa Palmer and Daniel Seekins are co-first authors.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The co-authors would like to thank Paul (Skip) Hayashi, MD, for his thoughtful review and valuable input into this manuscript.</p></ack><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title>Ethics Approval</title><p id="Par62">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar01"><title>Consent to Participate</title><p id="Par062">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar001"><title>Consent for Publication</title><p id="Par0062">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar0001"><title>Availability of Data and Material</title><p id="Par00062">Not Applicable.</p></notes><notes id="FPar00001"><title>Data sharing</title><p id="Par000062">Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed.</p></notes><notes id="FPar000001"><title>Software applications or Custom codes</title><p id="Par0000062">Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed.</p></notes><notes id="FPar0000001" notes-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par00000062">None.</p></notes><notes id="FPar2" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="Par63">Drs.
