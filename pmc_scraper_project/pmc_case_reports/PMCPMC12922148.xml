Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-medsci-14-00084"><title>1.1. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease</title><p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver disease worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of 38% in adults, driven by increasing obesity and metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-medsci-14-00084">1</xref>]. MASLD confers a significant increase in morbidity and premature mortality via increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-medsci-14-00084">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-medsci-14-00084">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-medsci-14-00084">4</xref>], as well as the potential progression of liver disease to cirrhosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="medsci-14-00084-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-medsci-14-00084">5</xref>]. Additionally, the world is transitioning to an older population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-medsci-14-00084">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-medsci-14-00084">7</xref>], with recent data demonstrating that MASLD currently affects almost one-third of community-dwelling older Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-medsci-14-00084">8</xref>]. In older adults, MASLD is associated with frailty, social disadvantage, poor exercise tolerance, diabetes, and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-medsci-14-00084">8</xref>]. Current treatment paradigms for MASLD are centred around weight loss and optimisation of other medical comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-medsci-14-00084">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-medsci-14-00084">10</xref>], with a vital need for pharmacotherapeutic agents to treat the condition itself. A detailed description of the pathophysiology of MASLD is beyond the scope of this paper. In brief, hepatic steatosis is defined as the presence of at least 5% of hepatocytes containing lipid vacuoles/triglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-medsci-14-00084">11</xref>]. MASLD is identified in individuals with hepatic steatosis in the absence of so-called ‘secondary’ and genetic causes (e.g., prednisolone use, excess alcohol use, abetalipoproteinaemia), and in the presence of at least one cardiometabolic comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-medsci-14-00084">10</xref>]. Hepatic steatosis is often described as the result of a ‘multiple-hit’ phenomenon, where insulin resistance, adipokines, gut microbiotal products, nutritional intake, and genetic predisposition cause, in parallel and in tandem, the development of steatosis and potentially progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-medsci-14-00084">12</xref>]. This process is complex but involves dysregulated lipid metabolism, mitochondria-derived Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and inflammasome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-medsci-14-00084">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-medsci-14-00084"><title>1.2. Statins</title><p>Japanese scientist Akira Endo discovered statins in the 1960s following his search for cholesterol-lowering agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-medsci-14-00084">13</xref>]. Subsequent Nobel-prize winning work by Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein showed that statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and consequently reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-medsci-14-00084">14</xref>]. It is well established that the primary mechanism of action of statins is the competitive blocking the active site of HMG-CoA reductase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-medsci-14-00084">15</xref>]. Within the liver, this leads to an inhibition of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to the upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors, thus increasing the clearance of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-medsci-14-00084">16</xref>]. This leads to a reduction in circulating LDL-C levels by 22–55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-medsci-14-00084">17</xref>]. However, in addition to reducing LDL-C, statins have other non-lipid related, pleiotropic effects, thought to be due to inhibition of the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-medsci-14-00084">17</xref>]. These include improvements in endothelial function; stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques; anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-thrombotic effects; positive effects on bone metabolism; and a reduction in the risk of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-medsci-14-00084">15</xref>]. Given the inextricable link between MASLD and metabolic dysfunction, there is good reason to believe that many of the pleiotropic benefits of statins may have clinical benefits in both MASLD and the progressive form of the disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), through reducing hepatic steatogenesis, as well as protecting against fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-medsci-14-00084">18</xref>].</p><p>Statins are the most widely used lipid-lowering drug in the world. In the United States, nearly 30% of adults over 40 years old are taking a statin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-medsci-14-00084">19</xref>]. Furthermore, in 2011, the British Heart Foundation reported that one million statin prescriptions were provided each week in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-medsci-14-00084">20</xref>]. The choice of statin in clinical practice is based on several factors, including potency, subtype (hydrophilic vs. lipophilic), and other concurrent medication use. The most potent of the statins are rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. These are used as first-line, high-intensity, LDL-C lowering therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-medsci-14-00084">21</xref>]. Statins can be further divided into lipophilic (simvastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin) and hydrophilic (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) statins. The lipophilic group can more easily enter cells, whereas hydrophilic statins have greater hepatoselectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-medsci-14-00084">22</xref>]. Although the benefits of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is well established, the superiority of hydrophilic vs. lipophilic statins is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-medsci-14-00084">22</xref>]. The class difference has the greatest clinical significance with respect to adverse effects, with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMs) more commonly associated with lipophilic statin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-medsci-14-00084">23</xref>].</p><p>Given the strong relationship between MASLD and cardiovascular disease, there is a significant focus on the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular medicines in liver disease. Statins are effective for both primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-medsci-14-00084">24</xref>] via not only LDL-C reduction but also potentially through other important pleiotropic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>]. Historically, statins have been under-prescribed in the MASLD patient population, given concerns around hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-medsci-14-00084">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-medsci-14-00084">27</xref>]. However, the safety of statin use in liver disease, and particularly MASLD, is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-medsci-14-00084">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-medsci-14-00084">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-medsci-14-00084">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-medsci-14-00084">31</xref>]. Recent research has demonstrated that statin use for primary prevention in MASLD patients has increased over time, but that guideline-based use remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-medsci-14-00084">32</xref>].</p><p>This review will aim to explore the evidence demonstrating benefits of statin therapy, not only for the conventional lipid-lowering indications in MASLD, but also for the potential benefits of using statin therapy for the treatment MASLD. In exploring the effects of statin therapy on the complications of chronic liver disease (e.g., portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma), other aetiologies of liver disease, in addition to MASLD, will also be explored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-medsci-14-00084"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>In order to formulate a review of the current literature on the efficacy and safety of statins in liver disease, in particular in MASLD and in cirrhosis of any aetiology, the electronic databases, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL, were searched from their inception until September 2025. The search was performed using multiple keywords in combination, including HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors, Statins, Fatty Liver, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver, Hypolipidemic Agents, Liver Disease, Liver Cirrhosis, Portal Hypertension, Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease, Steatotic Liver Disease, and Metabolic and Alcohol Associated Liver Disease. Given the global nomenclature change from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to MASLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-medsci-14-00084">33</xref>], our search strategy used both terms to capture the largest relevant literature possible. This approach is supported by work showing almost complete clinical concordance between definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-medsci-14-00084">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-medsci-14-00084">35</xref>], including in older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-medsci-14-00084">8</xref>]. Studies from any country were assessed; however, studies were limited to those in the English language only. Pre-clinical and non-human studies were included if they were determined to be useful to expand on the relevant concepts, specifically if they reported on the in vitro effects of statins on various aspects of hepatic function. Additional material was identified through the References section of relevant papers and personal knowledge of the literature. Only published papers were included.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-medsci-14-00084"><title>3. Statins and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)</title><p>As previously described, the pleiotropic (potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-oxidative, and anti-thrombotic) effects of statins have plausible clinical benefits in both MASLD and MASH, such as reducing hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and protecting against hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-medsci-14-00084">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="medsci-14-00084-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="medsci-14-00084-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="medsci-14-00084-t003">Table 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="medsci-14-00084-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3dot1-medsci-14-00084"><title>3.1. Association Between Statin Use and Hepatic Steatosis</title><p>The association between statins and MASLD has been well studied in both observational and several randomised controlled trials, and the results are generally positive, with many studies suggesting that statins might reduce the risk of developing MASLD through a reduction in hepatic steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-medsci-14-00084">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-medsci-14-00084">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38-medsci-14-00084">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-medsci-14-00084">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40-medsci-14-00084">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-medsci-14-00084">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42-medsci-14-00084">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43-medsci-14-00084">43</xref>]. A Cochrane meta-analysis on the effect of statins on MASLD and MASH based on two small trials (with a high risk of bias) found that statins improve both serum aminotransferase levels and sonographic hepatic steatosis; however, they did not demonstrate improvements in liver histology or liver-related mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-medsci-14-00084">44</xref>]. One randomised controlled trial showed a reduction in the odds of hepatic steatosis by 71% after 4 years of a combination of atorvastatin 20 mg/daily, vitamin C, and vitamin E in participants with radiographically diagnosed MASLD, although it is impossible to ascertain how much of the treatment effect is due to the statin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45-medsci-14-00084">45</xref>]. Although statins have been shown to have an association with a reduction in hepatic steatosis, people without dyslipidaemia (and not on a statin therapy) seem to have the lowest risk of MASLD, indicating that statins do not entirely ameliorate the risk for MASLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-medsci-14-00084">18</xref>]. Importantly, other studies have also demonstrated that a higher dose and longer duration of statin has a significant effect on the development and progression of MASLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-medsci-14-00084">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-medsci-14-00084">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46-medsci-14-00084">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47-medsci-14-00084">47</xref>]. In vitro studies on 3D cultured human liver organoids found that higher concentrations of statins significantly inhibited the number of lipid droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-medsci-14-00084">18</xref>]. However, the question of dose and duration of the statin on the effects of MASLD progression remains essentially unanswered and warrants further research. Despite the majority of evidence pointing towards a benefit on hepatic steatosis with statin use, there have been two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that did not show an improvement in hepatic steatosis with statin use: one of these trials was small, with a high risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48-medsci-14-00084">48</xref>], and the other used a lower-potency statin, pitavastatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-medsci-14-00084">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-medsci-14-00084"><title>3.2. Association Between Statin Use and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis</title><p>Simple hepatic steatosis, with or without inflammation, is thought to have a generally benign course; however, the progressive form of MASLD, MASH, can further progress to fibrosis and subsequently cirrhosis, resulting in liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50-medsci-14-00084">50</xref>].

Additionally, a recent cohort study of 16,501 patients with chronic liver disease, encompassing several aetiologies of liver disease including hepatitis C, alcohol related liver disease, and MASLD, demonstrated that patients who were on a statin were more likely to transition from high to intermediate or low FIB-4 score (a non-invasive, composite laboratory and age-based score to assess the risk of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81-medsci-14-00084">81</xref>]) groups and less likely to remain in the high group than were non-users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82-medsci-14-00084">82</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-medsci-14-00084"><title>4.3. Portal Hypertension</title><p>Portal hypertension is the main driver of hepatic decompensation events in patients with cirrhosis, leading to increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83-medsci-14-00084">83</xref>]. Although non-selective beta blockers remain part of the standard of care for patients with portal hypertension, up to 45% of patients fail to achieve sufficient portal pressure reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84-medsci-14-00084">84</xref>]. There is burgeoning interest in the use of statins as an additional therapeutic option to improve portal hypertension. In cirrhosis, an inadequate release of nitric oxide contributes to increased hepatic resistance and portal pressure, which in turn enhances the post prandial increase in portal pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85-medsci-14-00084">85</xref>]. There are thought to be a few mechanisms through which statins improve portal hypertension. Transcription factor KLF-2 protects endothelial cells through the induction of vasoprotective genes. In cirrhosis, KLF-2 is overexpressed early during the progression of the disease. However, it does not slow down the development of vascular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-medsci-14-00084">57</xref>]. Simvastatin has been shown to activate the KLF-2–nitric oxide pathway. Upregulation of this pathway induces a profound improvement in portal hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and liver fibrosis. The beneficial effects of KLF-2 are due to the inactivation and apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells, as well as a reduction in hepatic oxidative stress and improvement in endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57-medsci-14-00084">57</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that simvastatin use in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension leads to an overall decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), with haemodynamic effects greater in those with more severe portal hypertension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="medsci-14-00084-t004">Table 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85-medsci-14-00084">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86-medsci-14-00084">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87-medsci-14-00084">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88-medsci-14-00084">88</xref>], with one study also demonstrating a survival benefit in those with Child–Pugh A and Child–Pugh B cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89-medsci-14-00084">89</xref>].

The risk is highest in the first year of therapy, with dosage increases and in the setting of polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-medsci-14-00084">68</xref>]. Prevalence differs between classes, the highest risk involving lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin). Hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin have less muscle penetration and therefore, are less associated with SAMSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-medsci-14-00084">15</xref>]. Other risk factors include high statin dose, older age, frailty, female sex, low BMI, and concurrent ethanol (ETOH) use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-medsci-14-00084">68</xref>]. There are also genetic risk factors for SAMSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123-medsci-14-00084">123</xref>]. Caution should be taken when statins are used in combination with fibrates due to a higher risk of statin-induced myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-medsci-14-00084">9</xref>]. The prevalence of SAMSs in people with cirrhosis is comparable to that of the general population; however, more data are needed, particularly in cases of advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-medsci-14-00084">68</xref>]. In one large RCT evaluating statin use (simvastatin 40 mg daily), 19% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis experienced rhabdomyolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124-medsci-14-00084">124</xref>]. Simvastatin is extensively metabolized by the liver, with a first-pass effect, and is highly protein bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89-medsci-14-00084">89</xref>]. Therefore, overall, caution is suggested for use in advanced cirrhosis (Child–Pugh &gt; 9), given the limited data for this patient population, as well as avoidance of high-dose simvastatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-medsci-14-00084">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot2-medsci-14-00084"><title>6.2.

Furthermore, transient ALT elevation is higher in lipophilic statin- rather than hydrophilic statin-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130-medsci-14-00084">130</xref>]. One meta-analysis of over 50,000 people demonstrated no difference in LFTs between statin and placebo groups after 12 weeks of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131-medsci-14-00084">131</xref>]. Severe, idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132-medsci-14-00084">132</xref>], and progression to liver fibrosis has not been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-medsci-14-00084">30</xref>]. In addition, statin-induced autoimmune hepatitis is rare but described, and can be treated with immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133-medsci-14-00084">133</xref>]. Another meta-analysis of around 50,000 patients treated with statins confirmed the safety of patients with MASLD and elevated LFTs. The authors also found that patients with hyperlipidaemia and MASLD have fluctuations in transaminases, regardless of whether they are treated with a statin or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134-medsci-14-00084">134</xref>]. Current clinical practice guidelines suggest that patients with chronic liver disease and/or mild elevations in serum transaminases should be considered eligible for satin use. Furthermore, many patients with mild elevations in liver enzymes likely have concurrent MASLD and would benefit the most from the initiation and continuation of lipid-lowering therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68-medsci-14-00084">68</xref>]. Interestingly, there has been good data to suggest that patients with MASLD taking a statin actually show an improvement in their serum aminotransferase levels, likely reflecting the improvement in hepatic steatosis associated with statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-medsci-14-00084">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44-medsci-14-00084">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135-medsci-14-00084">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136-medsci-14-00084">136</xref>]. Given the fact that mild ALT elevations have not been shown to be associated with true hepatotoxicity or changes in liver function, routine monitoring of ALT during statin therapy is no longer recommended in clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot3-medsci-14-00084"><title>6.3. New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus</title><p>New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) has been associated with statin use and is predominantly seen in older patients with pre-existing metabolic comorbidities receiving high-dose statin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-medsci-14-00084">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137-medsci-14-00084">137</xref>]. It appears to be a class effect, with NODM developing with both hydrophilic and lipophilic statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-medsci-14-00084">138</xref>]. The mechanism by which statins cause NODM is complex and remains poorly understood. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been postulated; however the end result is that of reduced insulin secretion and reduced insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138-medsci-14-00084">138</xref>]. Data from meta-analyses has shown that statin therapy is associated with a 9% increased risk of developing NODM, and that high-dose statin, compared to moderate-dose statin, is associated with a higher incidence of NODM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139-medsci-14-00084">139</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140-medsci-14-00084">140</xref>]. In addition, the higher potency statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) appear to have a stronger association with NODM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B141-medsci-14-00084">141</xref>]. However, despite this increased risk of NODM, the data still demonstrates an overwhelming benefit in terms of the reduction of cardiovascular events, and therefore, the benefits of intensive statin therapy significantly outweigh the risk of NODM. This benefit has also been confirmed in a primary prevention setting with a lower-risk population, where the overall beneficial effect of statin therapy on vascular events was greater (almost 2.5 fold) than the hazard of developing NODM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142-medsci-14-00084">142</xref>]. This potential adverse event caused by statins needs to be carefully considered in the context of patients with MASLD, given their predisposition to having higher insulin resistance compared to that of the general population. For example, it may be prudent to monitor Hba1c more closely in patients with MASLD without diabetes who are taking a statin. Further prospective research is required to assess the risk of patients with MASLD developing NODM while taking a statin.</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot4-medsci-14-00084"><title>6.4. Cognitive Impairment</title><p>Statins have been linked to short-term, reversible cognitive impairment since their inception. A phase 1 clinical trial of atorvastatin demonstrated that escalating doses showed a dose-dependent adverse reaction of mild, transient mental confusion, together with restlessness and euphoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143-medsci-14-00084">143</xref>]. However, these effects were not reported to in the phase 2 and 3 trials to the degree that they could be recognised as side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-medsci-14-00084">144</xref>].

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a label change for all statins, informing prescribers and patients that cognitive side effects are a risk when taking statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144-medsci-14-00084">144</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether cognitive impairment occurs at a similar frequency in patients with liver disease; however, some research has shown that hepatic encephalopathy, a condition seen in progressive liver disease, is observed less frequently in the setting of statin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101-medsci-14-00084">101</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot5-medsci-14-00084"><title>6.5. Other Adverse Drug Reactions</title><p>Other reported statin-mediated adverse events include cataracts, urogenital side effects, gynecomastia, mild proteinuria, haemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal effects, and reproductive effects.

Drug–Drug Interactions</title><p>There are several important drug interactions with statins that may increase the risk of adverse effects, particularly myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>]. Most available statins (except pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) undergo major hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. CYP3A4 isoenzymes are the most implicated in the metabolism of statins (others being CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6). Therefore, other pharmacological substrates of the CYPs may interfere with statin metabolism and vice versa, and statin therapy may interfere with the metabolism of other implicated medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B146-medsci-14-00084">146</xref>]. In addition to their implications in the CYP system, statin inhibition or induction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an intracellular tissue-specific transport system, may also result in drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-medsci-14-00084">147</xref>]. Drug interactions have been reported between statins and P-gp substrates, including digoxin, diltiazem, and verapamil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-medsci-14-00084">147</xref>]. Importantly, there is a significant overlap between agents that are both CYP3A4 and P-gp substrates or inhibitors. Research has demonstrated that atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin inhibited P-gp mediated transport, and co-administration with these statins and other P-gp substrates or inhibitors may result in increased bioavailability of these statins and thus, an increased risk of adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B147-medsci-14-00084">147</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="medsci-14-00084-t005" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">medsci-14-00084-t005_Table 5</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Safety and efficacy of individual statins.

Safety and Efficacy of Statins Between the Sexes</title><p>There is well-established evidence examining the efficacy and safety of statins between the sexes. Meta-analysis data looking at the efficacy of statins in both sexes found that the benefits of statins in reducing MACE and all-cause mortality occurs equally between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B152-medsci-14-00084">152</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B153-medsci-14-00084">153</xref>]. The difference between the sexes is largely in the safety and tolerability of statins. Women report higher rates of SAMSs compared to men; this effect appears to increase with age and is dose-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B154-medsci-14-00084">154</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B155-medsci-14-00084">155</xref>]. Although relatively few discontinue statin therapy, women are more likely to discontinue statin therapy compared to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156-medsci-14-00084">156</xref>]. Additionally, there have been higher reported rates of new-onset diabetes mellitus associated with statin use in women compared to in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B157-medsci-14-00084">157</xref>]. Furthermore, women are more prone to the nocebo and drucebo effects of statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B155-medsci-14-00084">155</xref>]. Specifically, in patients with MASLD, there has also been evidence highlighting that statins are under-prescribed in women compared to men, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158-medsci-14-00084">158</xref>]. The reasons for the differences in statin use between sexes includes that women are offered statin therapy less commonly than men, and women tend to discontinue statin therapy more frequently than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B156-medsci-14-00084">156</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B158-medsci-14-00084">158</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B159-medsci-14-00084">159</xref>]. Greater clinician awareness of gender-specific side effects would hopefully lead to improved clinician sensitivity during prescribing and thus, an improved adherence to statins among women. This is of paramount importance in the MASLD population, given the association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-medsci-14-00084">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec8-medsci-14-00084"><title>8. Statins in Older Adults</title><p>The world is rapidly transitioning towards an older population, with almost twice as many people surviving beyond 80 years now compared to the numbers noted 50 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-medsci-14-00084">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-medsci-14-00084">7</xref>].

However, despite this, the use of statin therapy declines with increasing age, likely reflecting a difference in both prescription and adherence when compared to younger cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B160-medsci-14-00084">160</xref>]. The effect of statins on older people has been relatively understudied, with few patients &gt;75 years of age included in statin trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B161-medsci-14-00084">161</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B162-medsci-14-00084">162</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B163-medsci-14-00084">163</xref>]. While the benefits of statins in the treatment of ASCVD is clear across all age groups, in people without ASCVD, the benefits are not as clear in older adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="medsci-14-00084-t006">Table 6</xref>). As such, there are currently no strong prescribing guidelines for older adults without ASCVD, a limitation that is currently being addressed by the STAtin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B164-medsci-14-00084">164</xref>]. With respect to the adverse effects of statins in older adults, these remain of particular concern due to increased comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, polypharmacy, and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that occur with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>]. However, as with efficacy, the extent of statin adverse events in older adults has not been well studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B145-medsci-14-00084">145</xref>]. Drug interactions are a concern, as discussed above, and as such, statins are recommended to be commenced at low dose if there is significant renal impairment or potential for drug interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-medsci-14-00084">25</xref>]. With respect to hepatic adverse events, a recent retrospective cohort study looking at 167,112 adverse events due to statins, of which there were 7779 reported cases of DILI, the authors found that DILI cases predominantly occurred in older patients (≥65 years), with 45.43% of cases occurring in that age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B165-medsci-14-00084">165</xref>].

Statins in MASLD—Unanswered Questions</title><p>Pre-clinical and clinical trials to date have shown that statins may be beneficial in preventing MASLD, MASH, and hepatic fibrosis. There are also promising results with respect to the potential benefits advanced chronic liver disease and its complications, as well as reductions in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, large, prospective trials remain scarce, particularly those involving robust histological endpoints to examine the effects of statins on MASH and hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, although many studies have revealed positive results, some of the available evidence remains contradictory or inconclusive. Further studies are required to examine the hepatoprotective effects of statins in patients with MASLD who do not have a conventional indication for statin therapy, i.e., in primary prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-medsci-14-00084"><title>10. Conclusions</title><p>As highlighted by this review, statins are one of the most prescribed medications worldwide and are highly effective in the treatment and prevention of ASCVD. Despite the well-established safety of statins in MASLD, statins remain under-prescribed in patients with MASLD, a condition commonly associated with the same co-morbidities as ASCVD. Most importantly are the cardiovascular benefits, with data showing that statin treatment halves the mortality and morbidity associated with ASCVD in patients with MASLD/MASH. Additionally, statins reduce cardiovascular events by two-thirds in patients with MASLD/MASH compared to in those not on a statin. There is growing evidence that statins may in fact improve hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, carry benefits in cirrhosis with portal hypertension, and reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, statins should be more widely considered in patients with MASLD not only to reduce the progression and complications of disease such as MASH and fibrosis but also to reduce cardiovascular events, mortality, and morbidity. Increased awareness amongst physicians, particularly in the primary care setting, is needed to improve the uptake of statin therapy in MASLD patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to examine whether statins are hepatoprotective in MASLD patients without a conventional indication for statin therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
