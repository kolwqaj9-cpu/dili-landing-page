In this study, the toxic effects of ritonavir, lopinavir, and alcohol on hepatocyte transporters and the secretion of bile acids and bilirubin were investigated in hydrogen peroxide-induced senescent HepG2 and doxorubicin-induced senescent primary human hepatocytes. In HepG2, intracellular conjugated bilirubin increased upon senescence and extracellular conjugated bilirubin in culture medium was decreased by ritonavir and lopinavir treatment. In the primary hepatocytes, intracellular bile acids or medium bilirubin were not significantly changed upon senescence. However, intracellular bile acids were increased, and medium conjugated bilirubin were decreased in senescent primary hepatocytes treated with alcohol and the two drugs. Transcriptional expressions of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (ABCB4, ABCC6, ABCB11, and ABCD3) were decreased whereas UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) was increased by ritonavir and lopinavir in senescent HepG2. In senescent primary hepatocytes, expressions of ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC6 were apparently reduced whereas UGT1A1 and the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP7A1 were markedly increased by alcohol combined with ritonavir and lopinavir. Selective ABCC6 knockdown in the primary hepatocytes altered expressions of two senescence markers, Lamin A/C and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKI (p21), increased expressions of CYP7A1 and hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and increased intracellular bile acids. Further, anti-cholestasis agents, ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizin, significantly ameliorated the impaired secretions of bile acids and bilirubin as well as reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and cell death caused by ritonavir, lopinavir, and alcohol in the primary hepatocytes with ABCC6 knockdown. These results indicate that senescence moderately impairs the ABC transporters of hepatocytes and secretion of bile acids or bilirubin, which become worse in the presence of the drugs and alcohol but could be improved by anti-cholestasis agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alcohol/drug use disorders</kwd><kwd>anti-HIV drugs</kwd><kwd>hepatocyte bile acid secretion</kwd><kwd>bilirubin secretion</kwd><kwd>ABC transporters</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH)</funding-source><award-id>R01DA058458</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported in part by the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) grant R01DA058458.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijms-27-01189" sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The population aged 60 and older worldwide is increasing, which gives rise to significant new healthcare challenges such as the excessive use of prescription medications and increased rates of alcohol consumption or combined drug–alcohol exposure among the elderly due to social isolation or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-ijms-27-01189">1</xref>]. Aging-related decline in major human organs including the liver is rising. A leading cause of liver injury is alcohol and/or drug uses that contribute to rising rates of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-ijms-27-01189">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijms-27-01189">3</xref>]. Alcohol-/drug-induced hepatotoxicity involves cellular oxidative stress, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation, which could be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. One of the important mechanisms underlying the drug-/alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity is the impaired secretion of bile acids and bilirubin that leads to the toxic accumulation of bile acids and/or bilirubin within hepatocytes and subsequent liver cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijms-27-01189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>]. The secretion of bile acids and bilirubin involves basolateral and canicular transporters such as the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, key factors in cholesterol and bile acid synthesis and metabolism such as the hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and cytochrome P450 CPY7A1, bilirubin conjugation enzymes such as the enzyme glucuronyltransferase (UGT1A1), and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Previous studies from us and others indicate that drugs/alcohol disrupt bile acid uptake, process, and transport, contributing to cholestatic disease in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijms-27-01189">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijms-27-01189">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijms-27-01189">7</xref>]. In mice intoxicated with ethanol, the elevation of the total bile acid pool including free taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-ijms-27-01189">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijms-27-01189">7</xref>]. Expressions of CYP7A1 along with bile acid excretion transporters including ABCB1, ABCB11, and ABCC2 were upregulated whereas the liver bile acid uptake transporter LBAT/NTCB and nuclear receptor FXR were downregulated by alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-ijms-27-01189">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijms-27-01189">8</xref>]. The anti-HIV protease inhibitors, ritonavir and lopinavir, used in current regimens are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, which consequently affects the metabolism of bile acids and bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>]. Ritonavir and lopinavir also inhibit bile acid transporters, including ABCB3, ABCB11/BSEP (bile salt export pump), ABCC2, and the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which disturb the secretion and homeostasis of bile acids and bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>]. In senescent hepatocytes or aging liver, evidence has emerged that there are adverse effects of drugs and alcohol on the ABC transporters and bile acid/bilirubin secretion. A recent clinical case report indicated that, in an elderly patient, ritonavir and lopinavir were associated with persistent hepatic secretion failure, which might involve the transporter ABCC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijms-27-01189">9</xref>]. The ABCC6 defect has been identified as a cause for an autosomal recessive disease termed pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijms-27-01189">10</xref>], which is also associated with disorders of cholesterol/bile acid metabolism and obstructive jaundice in a PXE-affected 61-year-old female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijms-27-01189">11</xref>]. In addition, aging is reported to disrupt bile acid homeostasis leading to cholestasis, fatty liver diseases, and hepatic carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-ijms-27-01189">12</xref>]. These lines of evidence prompt us to hypothesize that aging is an influential factor for the drug-/alcohol-induced secretion impairment of bile acids and bilirubin and consequent hepatic injury. Senescence could be induced by different stresses and oxidative stress is the most common stress factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-ijms-27-01189">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-ijms-27-01189">14</xref>]. The pro-oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has been used to induce cell senescence in in vitro models and doxorubicin is also a pro-oxidant, which at lower doses has recently been used for senescence induction of more physiologically relevant primary human cells as well as for liver aging induction in animal models, which is associated with the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijms-27-01189">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijms-27-01189">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijms-27-01189">17</xref>]. In this study, we applied either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or doxorubicin as the senescence inducer and found evidence supporting that in senescent human hepatocytes, ritonavir, lopinavir, and alcohol have detrimental impacts on ABC transporters, bile acid/bilirubin metabolic enzymes, and the secretion of bile acids and bilirubin.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-27-01189" sec-type="results"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-27-01189"><title>2.1. Effects of Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Alcohol on Secretion of Bile Acids or Bilirubin in Senescent Hepatocytes</title><p>One of the important biological functions of hepatocytes is the secretion of bile acids and conjugated bilirubin, which contributes to bile acid/bilirubin homeostasis. Either ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV) has been shown to interfere with the secretion of bile acids or conjugated bilirubin leading to the accumulation of bile acids inside the liver cells or elevation of serum bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-ijms-27-01189">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijms-27-01189">5</xref>]. Senescent hepatocytes were induced to test how the effects of ritonavir and lopinavir on the secretion were different. Senescence of HepG2 was induced by treating the cells with hydrogen peroxide, which was indicated by an increased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The HepG2 cells were treated with RTV and LPV and then incubated in fresh media containing bilirubin for five hours before secretion measurements. Levels of cellular unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) were decreased in senescent HepG2 compared to the non-senescent control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). RTV and LPV treatments increased the cellular UCB in the senescent cells but not in the control cells. There was a significant difference in UCB between the drug-treated control and senescent HepG2. In the culture media, the UCB levels were not changed between control and senescent cells but, upon treatment with the anti-HIV drugs, UCB levels in the medium were reduced in control or senescent cells and there was no difference between control and senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Conjugated bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) increased dramatically inside the senescent HepG2 compared to control HepG2, and RTV and LPV did not affect further the BMG levels in either control or senescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The BMG levels were markedly increased in the media upon senescence, which were decreased by RTV and LPV in the senescent HepG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p><p>Premature senescence was induced in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) by treating cells with doxorubicin, which had increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKI (p21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Before measuring the secretions, the PHHs were treated with RTV, LPV, and/or ethanol and then incubated in fresh media containing cholic acid for five hours. The status of senescence of PHHs had little effect on the levels of intracellular bile acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). In the non-senescent PHHs, the levels of intracellular bile acids were increased significantly by ethanol combined with RTV or LPV but were not affected by RTV, LPV, or ethanol alone. In the senescent PHHs, the levels of intracellular bile acids were increased significantly by RTV and LPV or by ethanol alone. Alcohol and the drugs together had synergistic effects on the intracellular bile acids of senescent PHHs, which were increased by more than 50%. The extracellular bile acids in the medium of non-senescent PHHs were decreased slightly by RTV and LPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f002">Figure 2</xref>D), whereas in the senescent PHHs, the extracellular bile acids were decreased by RTV and LPV, or ethanol alone, which were decreased further by the drug–ethanol combination, indicating a severe secretion impairment of bile acids in the senescent primary hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-27-01189"><title>2.2.

The expression of p21 protein was upregulated and the expression of Lamin A/C was downregulated, indicating that the PHHs with the ABCC6 knockdown were at a status of senescence. The ABCC6 knockdown did not affect the expression of the same class transporter, ABCC3, but exerted mixed effects on expressions of other class transporters, ABCB11 and ABCG5. ABCB11 was slightly increased by the knockdown whereas ABCG5 was not changed. In addition, upon ABCC6 knockdown, hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and CYP7A1 which are necessary for the hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol and bile acids were moderately increased, whereas nuclear receptor FXR was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>The ABCC6 knockdown had an impact on the secretion of bile acids and bilirubin. Intracellular bile acids (i.e., bile acid accumulation) were increased in PHHs with ABCC6 knockdown compared to PHHs without ABCC6 knockdown, which was further increased by 16% by the RTV and LPV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Compared to the RTV and LPV treatment, ethanol treatment did not increase the levels of intracellular bile acids significantly in the PHHs with ABCC6 knockdown. However, alcohol combined with RTV and LPV increased the bile acid levels by nearly 50% PHHs with ABCC6 knockdown compared to PHHs without ABCC6 knockdown. Extracellular direct bilirubin (i.e., conjugated bilirubin) was not significantly changed between PHHs with and without ABCC6 knockdown or any drugs or alcohol treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). The extracellular levels of direct bilirubin were reduced by 15% when the ABCC6-deficient PHHs were treated with RTV and LPV, by 11% when treated with ethanol, and by 48% when treated with ethanol combined with the drugs. There was a synergistic effect of alcohol and drugs on the bilirubin secretion in the PHHs deficient in ABCC6, supporting the role of ABCC6 deficiency or senescence in the drug- and alcohol-induced secretion impairment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-27-01189"><title>2.4.

Glycyrrhizic acid (glycyrrhizin or GA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) were selected to test whether they were effective against RTV, LPV, and/or alcohol-induced downregulation of ABC transporters and secretion impairments of bile acids and bilirubin in the senescent human hepatocytes. GA treatment moderately recovered the mRNA expression of ABCB11 or ABCC6 that was reduced by RTV, LPV, and alcohol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). The expression of HMGCR that was upregulated by RTV, LPV, and alcohol was decreased by 7% by GA treatment. In contrast, UDCA treatment increased the expression of the transporters ABCB11 and ABCC6 significantly and decreased the expression of HMGCR by 22% compared to those of senescent PHHs treated with RTV, LPV, and alcohol. The cellular accumulation of bile acids which resulted from RTV, LPV, and alcohol treatment was reduced by 4.5% by GA and reduced by 13% by UDCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-27-01189-f007">Figure 7</xref>B).

Discussion</title><p>The hepatic secretion of bile acids and bilirubin is essential for the homeostasis of bile acids or bilirubin and the maintenance of digestive health in the body which is often associated with many chronic liver dysfunctions such as the abnormal accumulation of bile acids by alcohol and/or drugs. Toxic levels of bile acids may cause inflammation and cell death leading to cholestatic liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijms-27-01189">3</xref>]. It is not clear whether impaired hepatic secretion of bile acids and bilirubin by alcohol and drug exposures could deteriorate in the aging liver considering that elderly patients experience excessive use of prescription medications and a combined use of drug and alcohol. In this study, we investigated for the first time the hepatotoxic effects of antiviral drugs and/or alcohol on hepatocyte transporters and the secretion of bile acids and bilirubin in the hydrogen peroxide-induced senescent human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and doxorubicin-induced senescent primary human hepatocytes and made a few interesting preliminary findings. First, the impaired secretion of bile acids or bilirubin occurred in both HepG2 and primary human hepatocytes upon senescence or exposure to drugs and alcohol but to different degrees. In the human liver cancer cells, intracellular conjugated bilirubin increased upon senescence and extracellular conjugated bilirubin in culture medium was decreased by the antiviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir. In the primary human hepatocytes, the status of senescence did not have a significant impact on intracellular bile acids or medium bilirubin. However, in the presence of alcohol and the two antiviral drugs, intracellular bile acids were accumulated, and medium conjugated bilirubin was decreased in senescent primary hepatocytes. These observations suggest that, in the context of hepatic secretion, cancerous hepatocytes were more sensitive to the status of senescence than to alcohol and drugs whereas normal primary hepatocytes were more sensitive to the drug and alcohol challenges than to the status of senescence. While there are reports that bile acid-induced senescence in hepatic stellate cells could modulate the behavior of liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-ijms-27-01189">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-ijms-27-01189">26</xref>], it is not clear from this study whether the differences in bile acid profiles between HepG2 and PHHs would alter the impacts of senescence on the drug- and alcohol-induced impairments of bile acid/bilirubin secretion. It is also worth noting that although both doxorubicin and hydrogen peroxide are well known pro-oxidants that promote oxidative stress and induce cell senescence, doxorubicin at non-toxic lower doses has increasingly been used to investigate senescence/aging effects in both primary human cells and animal models that are physiologically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-ijms-27-01189">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-ijms-27-01189">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-ijms-27-01189">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-ijms-27-01189">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-ijms-27-01189">28</xref>]. The observed senescent effects on the ABC transporters and bile acid secretion in the doxorubicin-treated primary human hepatocytes likely reflect the effects of physiological aging in human hepatocytes on hepatic secretion in vivo.</p><p>Second, there are many molecular mechanisms that could lead to the impaired hepatic secretion of bile acids and bilirubin in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijms-27-01189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-ijms-27-01189">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-ijms-27-01189">29</xref>]. In this in vitro investigation, we examined bile acid/bilirubin transporters and a couple of key enzymes and factors for bile acid synthesis, bilirubin conjugation, and drug/alcohol metabolism. We found that the intracellular accumulation of bile acids likely did not result from increased bile acid uptake since significant changes were not detected upon senescence in either HepG2 or PHHs for the relevant transporters such as the organic anion transporter polypeptide members (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3), the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ASBT, and the basolateral sodium/bile acid co-transporter NTCP, which are involved in bile acid uptakes. Similarly, the reduced bilirubin secretion was not due to the reduced bilirubin conjugation required for the hepatic secretion given that the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 that catalyzes the conjugation was increased by the antiviral drugs, which was likely due to the structural modification of UGT1A1 by the anti-HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, resembling the molecular interactions between ritonavir and the human ortholog of STE24 protease observed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-ijms-27-01189">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-ijms-27-01189">31</xref>]. Thus, the possible causes for the intracellular bile acid accumulation might be a rise in bile acid synthesis and/or inhibition of the transporters for bile acid/bilirubin secretion. Two pieces of evidence obtained from this study support the possibilities. One is that the expression of CYP7A1 required for bile acid synthesis was increased in the control non-senescent PHHs treated with alcohol combined with the antiviral drugs, which were further increased in senescent PHHs. The other one is that expressions of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (ABCB4, ABCC6, ABCB11, and ABCD3) were reduced by ritonavir and lopinavir in senescent HepG2, and the expressions of ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC6 were reduced in senescent PHHs, the latter of which were further decreased by alcohol combined with ritonavir and lopinavir. In addition, the inhibition of ABC transporters may be directly related to the senescence of hepatocytes considering that no consistent changes for other factors including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and FXR that regulate either drug metabolism or bile acid homeostasis were detected between senescent and non-senescent hepatocytes treated with drugs and/or alcohol. It is worth investigating further the specific molecular mechanisms by which the oxidative stress-induced senescence of hepatocytes suppresses the ABC transporters for bile acid/bilirubin secretion.</p><p>Third, the transporter ABCC6 was originally known to prevent the ectopic mineralization seen in pseudoxanthoma elasticum by inducing cellular nucleotide release and pyrophosphate (PPi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijms-27-01189">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-ijms-27-01189">32</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that ABCC6 plays an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis that may indirectly affect bile metabolism and the hepatic secretion of bile acids/bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijms-27-01189">11</xref>]. Because it has been reported that knockdown of ABCC6 in HepG2 induced senescent-like cell phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-ijms-27-01189">20</xref>], we tested further the influence of senescence on bile acid/bilirubin secretion through knocking down ABCC6 in the primary human hepatocytes. We observed altered expressions of two senescence markers, Lamin A/C and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKI (p21), in the primary hepatocytes with ABCC6 being knocked down. Our results support the notion that ABCC6 deficiency may contribute to senescence of hepatocytes via interfering with the bile acid/bilirubin secretion. More interestingly, we also observed that expressions of CYP7A1 and hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) were increased in the PHHs with ABCC6 knockdown, which were accompanied with the accumulation of intracellular bile acids and reduced bilirubin secretion, suggesting that ABCC6 could be a cause for the severe persistent hepatocellular secretory failure observed recently in elderly patients who had ABCC6 gene mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijms-27-01189">9</xref>]. Thus, targeting the ABC transporters involving bile acid/bilirubin secretion might be a plausible strategy to tackle drug-/alcohol-induced hepatic secretion failure and complications. Since oxidative stress predominantly occurs in the hepatocytes due to the competition between alcohol and the drugs for the common metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>] and oxidative stress promotes cell senescence and injury, we tested two potential anti-cholestasis compounds, ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizin, and showed that both ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizin partially ameliorated the impaired secretions of bile acids and bilirubin, intracellular lipid accumulation, and cell death caused by ritonavir, lopinavir, and alcohol in the primary hepatocytes deficient in ABCC6. Ursodeoxycholic acid appeared better, which might be due to its function against oxidative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress often associated with alcohol and drug-induced hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-ijms-27-01189">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-ijms-27-01189">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-27-01189"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>The hepatocyte excretion of bile acids and bilirubin is an important physiological process that is critical for preventing the toxic accumulation of bile acids and bilirubin and subsequent injury in the liver and other organs. We demonstrated that senescence of hepatocytes in vitro due to oxidative stress had adverse effects on ABC transporters including ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, and ABCC6 that function in the hepatic secretion of bile acids or bilirubin, which become much worse in the presence of antiviral drugs combined with alcohol but could be improved by the anti-cholestasis agent ursodeoxycholic acid which functions against oxidative ER stress. Also, targeting the ABC transporters involving bile acid/bilirubin secretion might be a plausible strategy to tackle drug-/alcohol-induced hepatic secretion failure and its complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank USC Mann Multi-Omics Mass Spectrometry Core for technical support in operating the Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrum (LC–MS) and measuring the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and conjugated bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) in HepG2 cells and culture media.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
