In this context, “precision” also includes individualized risk assessment and management of immune-related toxicities—an important determinant of whether patients can safely continue effective immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Increasing numbers of new ICIs have been discovered, along with their approved indications for various types of cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-rmmj-17-1-e0005">1</xref></p><p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors modulate immune checkpoint pathways, which can lead to tumor regression and durable disease control in selected patients. There are three ICI classes: cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can be administered either alone or in combination with other cancer therapies such as surgery, conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other modalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-rmmj-17-1-e0005">2</xref></p><p>The widespread use of ICIs has been associated with improved prognosis and quality of life of specific groups of cancer patients, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and urothelial carcinoma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-rmmj-17-1-e0005">3</xref> However, as use expands, the incidence of ICI-related toxicity is expected to increase. Although ICI toxicities can be acute or long-term, they are typically associated with immune reactions and present acutely. These toxicities may lead to significant morbidity, impaired quality of life, and abrupt discontinuation of ICI therapy. The toxicity of ICIs varies depending on the ICI class and may affect various organs. In a previous paper, we discussed ICI-induced colitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-rmmj-17-1-e0005">4</xref> This narrative review discusses ICI hepatitis, a common ICI immune-related adverse event (irAE) affecting the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on immune-mediated liver injury caused by ICIs (ILICI), with emphasis on recent clinical guidelines and management strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception through October 2024. Search terms included combinations of “immune checkpoint inhibitor,” “immunotherapy,” “hepatotoxicity,” “hepatitis,” “liver injury,” “PD-1,” “PD-L1,” “CTLA-4,” and related terms. Randomized controlled trials, observational studies, case series, clinical practice guidelines, and expert consensus statements were included. Priority was given to current guidelines from major societies. This review provides an updated synthesis of ILICI epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management, based on the included literature. An emphasis is placed on the conceptual framework of ILICI as a distinct form of indirect drug-induced liver injury. Hence, a detailed comparative analysis of management recommendations across guidelines is provided, with particular attention given to special populations, including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and liver transplant recipients—groups that are often underrepresented in clinical trials but frequently encountered in practice. This emphasis supports a practical precision-oncology approach to risk stratification, monitoring, and management, discussed herein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>DEFINITIONS</title><p>Several different terms have been used to describe ICI hepatitis, including ILICI, immune-mediated hepatitis (IMH) induced by ICI, checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (CHILI), and immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hepatotoxicity (ICH).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-rmmj-17-1-e0005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-rmmj-17-1-e0005">7</xref></p><p>While ILICI can be seen as part of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), many experts consider ILICI a distinct type of DILI. Classically, DILI is divided into two types: intrinsic (direct) and idiosyncratic. Intrinsic DILI is usually predictable, dose-dependent, and has rapid onset after drug initiation. Idiosyncratic DILI, on the other hand, is dose-independent, unpredictable, and may have delayed onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-rmmj-17-1-e0005">8</xref> The DILI Initiative of the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development proposed that ILICI represents a third DILI category, distinct from the traditional intrinsic (direct) and idiosyncratic types. This proposal was based on its distinct mechanism, clinical presentation, and response to immunosuppression as well as the indirect, immune-mediated effects of ICIs on the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-rmmj-17-1-e0005">6</xref> In 2023, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) also proposed a third type of DILI called “indirect hepatotoxicity.” Accordingly, ILICI has been classified within this third DILI type. In contrast to intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI, indirect hepatotoxicity is partially predictable, dose-independent, and may have a latency for months. Additionally, it arises when the biological action of the drug affects the host immune system, leading to a secondary form of immune-mediated liver injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-rmmj-17-1-e0005">9</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>EPIDEMIOLOGY</title><p>During ICI therapy, excessive T cell activation and reduced regulatory T cell function can trigger immune-related adverse events across multiple organs, including ILICI. The incidence of ILICI has increased in recent years, making it the third most common ICI-related adverse effect (up to 30%) after dermatologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-rmmj-17-1-e0005">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-rmmj-17-1-e0005">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-rmmj-17-1-e0005">12</xref> In a retrospective study, Hountondji et al. observed three distinct clinical patterns of ILICI, namely hepatocellular (38.5%), cholestatic (36.8%), and mixed (24.8%); no severe acute cases were seen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-rmmj-17-1-e0005">5</xref> Other studies have also shown that the hepatocellular pattern was the most commonly observed pattern in patients with ILICI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-rmmj-17-1-e0005">7</xref></p><p>Cases of ILICI are characterized by a significant increase in transaminases, followed by a gradual or rapid decrease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-rmmj-17-1-e0005">13</xref> The onset of transaminase elevation usually occurs 4 to 12 weeks following the initiation of ICI treatment, or after receiving one to three doses of ICI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-rmmj-17-1-e0005">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-rmmj-17-1-e0005">18</xref> Importantly, ILICI can present with a delayed onset, occurring several months after treatment initiation or even after treatment cessation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-rmmj-17-1-e0005">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-rmmj-17-1-e0005">22</xref> Cases have been reported as early as 2–3 weeks and as late as 21 months after initiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-rmmj-17-1-e0005">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-rmmj-17-1-e0005">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-rmmj-17-1-e0005">20</xref> Delayed-onset cases have been documented, occurring 7–9 weeks or even up to 24 months after the last dose of ICI, emphasizing the need for prolonged clinical vigilance and monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-rmmj-17-1-e0005">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-rmmj-17-1-e0005">22</xref> Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for ILICI in patients with prior ICI exposure, even months after treatment discontinuation, and monitoring for immune-related adverse events, including liver function, should be individualized and may extend up to 12 months post-treatment cessation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-rmmj-17-1-e0005">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-rmmj-17-1-e0005">22</xref></p><p>Liver injury with a mixed pattern is usually seen at the beginning, while the hepatocellular injury pattern is seen at its peak. Fever may also be a clinical manifestation. In rare cases, acute liver failure is the first presentation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-rmmj-17-1-e0005">16</xref></p><p>Distinct patterns of liver injury have been observed with CTLA-4 versus PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: ILICI associated with anti-CTLA-4 is often more severe than with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1. Most ILICI cases are mild, but if they are not treated properly, there is a risk of acute liver failure and even death. In addition, inappropriate ILICI management can lead to the failure of cancer therapy. Therefore, ILICI has become an increasing concern.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-rmmj-17-1-e0005">10</xref></p><p>It is important to note that published studies use heterogeneous definitions of ILICI, ranging from any degree of liver enzyme elevation to clinically significant immune-mediated hepatitis requiring immunosuppression (e.g. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade ≥3). This variability contributes substantially to the wide range of incidence figures reported in the literature. The incidence of ILICI varies according to the type of ICI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-rmmj-17-1-e0005">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-rmmj-17-1-e0005">23</xref> Hepatotoxicity with PD-1 inhibitors was found to be between 1% and 3%, while the incidence of various grades of autoimmune hepatotoxicity with CTLA-4 inhibitors has been reported between 3% and 9%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-rmmj-17-1-e0005">14</xref> Furthermore, combination therapy is associated with a much higher incidence of hepatotoxicity, with incidence rates ranging from 13% to 30% for all grades and 6% to 19% for grade 3 or higher.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-rmmj-17-1-e0005">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-rmmj-17-1-e0005">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-rmmj-17-1-e0005">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-rmmj-17-1-e0005">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-rmmj-17-1-e0005">25</xref> The incidence of the different agents of ICI have been listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-rmmj-17-1-e0005">Table 1</xref>.

In addition, the incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels that were of grade 3 or above was also higher in the liver cancer group compared to other solid tumors (ALT increase: 4.57% [95% CI 3.38%–6.17%] versus 1.26% [95% CI 1.02%–1.56%], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001; AST increase: 6.74% [95% CI 4.09%–11.11%] versus 1.19% [95% CI 0.95%–1.48%], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-rmmj-17-1-e0005">69</xref> Overall, hepatocellular carcinoma patients may have a 2–3-fold higher risk of ILICI compared to other cancer types, and underlying chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may contribute to increased susceptibility. Therefore, baseline liver function assessment (Child–Pugh score) should be performed before ICI initiation, and more frequent monitoring of liver function may be warranted in hepatocellular carcinoma patients on ICIs. It is also important to distinguish ILICI from tumor progression, portal vein thrombosis, or decompensation of underlying liver disease.</p><p>One cohort study observed that females were more likely to experience ILICI than were males (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.09–6.06, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.03).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-rmmj-17-1-e0005">78</xref> This was also reported by another study involving 1096 participants (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.038).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79-rmmj-17-1-e0005">79</xref> A meta-analysis of 13 studies indicated that younger age was significantly associated with higher incidence of ILICI (weighted mean difference [WMD]: −5.200, 95% CI −7.481 to −2.919) and grade 3 or above ILICI (WMD: −5.193, 95% CI −9.669 to −0.718).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80-rmmj-17-1-e0005">80</xref></p><p>The presence of pre-existing liver diseases, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is thought to be a risk factor for hepatotoxicity when receiving ICIs. Animal studies have shown that ICI exposure in HBV- or HCV-infected animals was associated with elevated aminotransferase levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81-rmmj-17-1-e0005">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82-rmmj-17-1-e0005">82</xref> The available data on humans are limited, since most studies excluded patients with pre-existing liver conditions. A case series of nine individuals with HBV or HCV infection who received ICIs experienced elevations in aminotransferase levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83-rmmj-17-1-e0005">83</xref> Cirrhotic patients with HCV infection treated with tremelimumab also had a higher incidence of ALT elevation than did those without HCV (25% versus 3%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84-rmmj-17-1-e0005">84</xref> Although these few human studies suggest an association between hepatitis infection and a higher risk for hepatotoxicity, elevations in transaminase levels may also be due to the underlying hepatitis infection rather than ICI exposure. Thus, patients with chronic HBV should be considered for antiviral prophylaxis before ICI initiation to prevent reactivation. Reactivation of HBV can occur during or after ICI therapy; therefore HBV DNA should be monitored regularly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85-rmmj-17-1-e0005">85</xref> Chronic HCV infection does not appear to increase ILICI risk significantly; successful HCV treatment prior to ICI is preferred when feasible. Appropriate serological and virological testing should be carried out to distinguish ILICI from viral hepatitis reactivation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86-rmmj-17-1-e0005">86</xref></p><p>Very few studies have assessed the safety of ICIs in individuals with liver transplants. One of the concerns regarding ICI usage in this population is the risk of allograft rejection. In one study, as many as 7 out of 19 patients (39%) experienced allograft rejection, with the highest rates of rejection seen in those receiving combination therapy (50%), followed by nivolumab (33%), pembrolizumab (25%), and ipilimumab (12.5%) monotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87-rmmj-17-1-e0005">87</xref> On the other hand, several other cases have reported tolerability of ICIs in solid-organ transplant recipients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88-rmmj-17-1-e0005">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90-rmmj-17-1-e0005">90</xref> Such mixed results make it difficult to conclude the safety of ICIs in liver transplant recipients. However, given the high rate of allograft rejection, ICIs should be used cautiously, with careful risk-benefit assessment.</p><p>Patients with autoimmune diseases are another unique population that requires special attention with ICI usage. Studies have found that autoimmune patients have a notably higher occurrence of irAEs (29%–45%) and disease exacerbation (29%–47%) when on ICIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91-rmmj-17-1-e0005">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b96-rmmj-17-1-e0005">96</xref> Despite the higher irAE rates, these events did not have a significant impact on overall survival.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92-rmmj-17-1-e0005">92</xref> Furthermore, most of the cases were easily resolved without discontinuing ICIs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94-rmmj-17-1-e0005">94</xref> Therefore, pre-existing autoimmune disease is not an absolute contraindication to ICI therapy. More frequent monitoring for both disease flares and immune-related adverse events are recommended.
