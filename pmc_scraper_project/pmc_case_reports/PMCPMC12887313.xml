However, real-world evidence on the risk profiles is limited. We aimed to describe the clinical profiles and identify risk factors for antifibrotic DILI in real-world practice to inform risk mitigation strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A retrospective case-control study was conducted among patients receiving pirfenidone at our tertiary hospital between October 2011 and December 2022 (approval No. ES-2024-K064-01). Hepatic safety signals were also evaluated through disproportionality analysis of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) using reporting odds ratios (RORs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For pirfenidone, among 3,199 treated patients, 63 (3.18%) developed DILI, typically within two weeks of therapy initiation. Significant risk factors included body mass index (BMI) ≤23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [odds ratio (OR) =7.32, P&lt;0.001], ≥4 comorbidities (OR =7.18, P&lt;0.001), pre-existing liver disease (OR =3.31, P=0.004), and alcohol consumption (OR =4.52, P=0.002). FAERS analysis recorded 904 hepatic adverse event (AE) reports, with 338 positive signals, most involving men aged 65–74 years and occurring within 30 days of initiation (6.89%). For nintedanib, 3.2% of exposed patients experienced DILI.

In China, DILI constitutes a greater public health burden than in many Western countries, and its complex pathogenesis often involves immune-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).</p><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with a median survival of only 3–5 years after diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Pirfenidone and nintedanib are currently the only approved antifibrotic agents in the European Union and United States, and are widely prescribed across different healthcare settings without major differences between university and non-university hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Both drugs slow lung function decline but differ in their adverse reaction profiles, notably including pharmacologic liver injury that requires regular monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Clinical and real-world data suggest nintedanib generally has a similar or lower discontinuation rate than pirfenidone, and dose reductions do not appear to compromise its efficacy. These considerations highlight the importance of further real-world evaluation of hepatic safety profiles for both agents. The majority of these ADRs are gastrointestinal in nature and typically present with mild to moderate symptoms that can generally be managed effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Although systematic investigations into the ADRs of both drugs have been conducted, comprehensive analyses regarding some rare ADRs—such as drug-induced hepatic injury—remain insufficient due to limited observation periods and small sample sizes. Available data indicate that hepatic impairment resulting from either pirfenidone or nintedanib is characterized by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and occasionally total bilirubin (TBIL) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). In addition, previous studies reported fatalities associated with severe liver injury due to pirfenidone in 2018 and 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Subsequently, in 2020, the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued an alert indicating that pirfenidone poses a risk of serious liver injury, with an incidence rate estimated at approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). In the same year, a case of severe hepatotoxicity secondary to nintedanib was also documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Although hepatic injuries induced by pirfenidone and nintedanib are relatively rare compared to other ADRs, continuous post-marketing safety monitoring of these two medications is particularly crucial given their widespread clinical use globally. This monitoring is essential for the early identification and prevention of potential hepatotoxicity risks.</p><p>In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of liver injury cases associated with the use of antifibrotic drugs at a large tertiary hospital and examined reports of hepatic adverse events (AEs) in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) for pirfenidone and nintedanib. We summarize the risk profile of these medications concerning liver injury from a pharmacovigilance perspective. Due to the limited number of DILI cases observed in patients treated with nintedanib during this period, our risk factor analysis primarily focused on pirfenidone to identify its potential risk factors. The findings from this study provide valuable insights into the risk assessment for clinical applications of antifibrotic drugs, aiding healthcare professionals in developing more precise prevention and treatment strategies.

These medications were identified as primary suspected causes of reported AEs. The screening process employed system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) derived from version 27.0 of the International Dictionary of Medical Terms. The retrieved data were subsequently sorted, cleaned, and analyzed for visualization purposes. Data processing was performed using SAS 9.4 to facilitate statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Data mining</title><p>This study utilized the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method to extract AE signals.

In our real-world cohort, the observed DILI incidence was approximately 3.2% for both agents. As detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1"><italic toggle="yes">Table 1</italic></xref>, this finding is situated within a broad spectrum of reported incidences in the literature, which highlights significant variability depending on study design and likely reflects the inherent reporting biases in pharmacovigilance databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). In contrast to our incidence data, our FAERS analysis identified a stronger safety signal for nintedanib, which showed disproportionately higher reporting of severe hepatic AEs. This finding of an elevated risk with nintedanib is corroborated by a large Taiwanese cohort study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Crucially, our study addresses a key gap by providing the granular clinical details, such as CTCAE grading and time to onset, which are essential for risk characterization but are frequently unreported in the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1"><italic toggle="yes">Table 1</italic></xref>).</p><p>Both hospital and FAERS datasets revealed a predominance of elderly male patients among DILI cases, consistent with previous real-world evidence suggesting that elderly males may have increased susceptibility to pirfenidone-related AEs and DILI in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Conversely, a prospective study did not confirm age as an independent predictor, suggesting that risk profiles may be drug-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). In the context of pirfenidone, diminished hepatic metabolic capacity and reduced tolerance to drug toxicity in older patients may indirectly increase DILI risk, even if chronological age is not a direct determinant.</p><p>Integrated analysis indicated that DILI induced by both agents predominantly presents as elevations in AST and ALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). However, FAERS signal mining identified important differences in AE spectra: pirfenidone signals were mainly related to liver enzyme changes, whereas nintedanib signals encompassed more severe outcomes, including bilirubin abnormalities, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and toxic hepatitis. These findings underscore the need for heightened vigilance regarding the potential severity of nintedanib-associated liver injury in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical typing of pirfenidone-induced liver injury</title><p>Among 40 patients with pirfenidone-related DILI, cholestatic injury was the predominant pattern (67.5%), with elderly patients (≥61 years) representing the majority (66.7%). This pattern was consistent with WHO Safety Reporting Database analyses and was associated with higher mortality compared with hepatocellular or mixed types (17.5% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 2.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). The mean age of our DILI cohort was 61 years, indicating an elderly-dominated population. Given the slower recovery observed in cholestatic DILI, clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing pirfenidone to older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk factors for pirfenidone-related DILI</title><p>Our analysis identified BMI ≤23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, ≥4 comorbidities, underlying liver disease, and alcohol history as significant risk factors. Low-BMI patients demonstrated higher DILI incidence and mortality, consistent with European studies linking underweight status to poorer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Multiple comorbidities often require polypharmacy, increasing the risk of hepatotoxic drug-drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). Patients with hepatic impairment or alcohol use are especially vulnerable to accelerated DILI progression when exposed to hepatotoxic medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of pirfenidone and hepatoprotective agents</title><p>In our case-matched analysis, prophylactic hepatoprotective agents failed to reduce the incidence of DILI. The DILI rate was, in fact, numerically higher in the prophylactic cohort (50.0% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 17.3%), a finding likely attributable to a higher baseline prevalence of pre-existing liver disease in this group. These results therefore reinforce current guideline recommendations against the routine prophylactic use of these medications to mitigate DILI risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>).</p><p>While this study did not assess therapeutic interventions for established DILI, current clinical practice dictates an individualized management strategy tailored to the injury phenotype and severity. For instance, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate is indicated for severe acute hepatocellular or mixed DILI (typically CTCAE Grade 3–4) with marked ALT elevation. In contrast, bisabolol is generally reserved for milder, inflammatory cases (CTCAE Grade 1–2), while ursodeoxycholic acid remains the standard of care for cholestatic DILI characterized by hyperbilirubinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). Prioritizing such a stratified, monotherapy-based approach is critical for effectively managing established DILI.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and regulatory implications</title><p>FAERS data indicate that nearly 80% of hepatic AEs emerge within 30 days of treatment initiation, a period associated with severe outcomes and readmissions. This underscores the need for intensive early monitoring. In regions with low pharmacovigilance awareness, standardized AE reporting and targeted healthcare provider education could improve patient outcomes and strengthen drug safety surveillance.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study acknowledges several limitations in its investigation of the hepatic adverse effects associated with pirfenidone and nintedanib. Firstly, the data sourced from the FAERS database predominantly arises from spontaneous reporting by a diverse array of contributors, which may introduce biases related to the quality and completeness of these reports. Specifically, there are regional disparities within medication-using populations, and the data available for Asia is notably limited, potentially impacting the generalizability of our findings. Secondly, the signals detected through the ROR method indicate only statistical associations between these drugs and AEs; they do not establish a definitive causal relationship. Consequently, these associations necessitate further examination through advanced analytical methodologies and large-scale clinical trials. Furthermore, our real-world study was constrained to a single-center retrospective analysis based on medical records with a limited sample size, which, by its nature, cannot replace the evidence strength of well-designed prospective studies. This limitation precluded us from including certain risk factors such as concomitant medication use and from systematically assessing for DIAIH, potentially underestimating its true incidence. Lastly, it is essential to note that the clinical data employed in this study primarily derive from hospitalized patients, suggesting that the actual incidence of adverse effects may be higher than reported. Despite limitations related to sample size, we contend that our findings are informative and contribute significantly to understanding clinical outcomes and underlying diseases associated with these therapeutic agents.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study underscore the critical importance of monitoring pirfenidone and nintedanib due to their associated risks of liver injury. Our analysis of the FAERS database, along with real-world cases of AEs, highlights the necessity for cautious clinical application of these medications. In administering pirfenidone, particular attention should be directed towards patients with a BMI of 23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or lower, those presenting with four or more comorbidities, individuals with a history of liver disease, and those who have a history of alcohol consumption. It is imperative to closely monitor their hepatic function and overall clinical condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait" position="float"><p>The article’s supplementary files as</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="su1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><media id="d67e1483" orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="tgh-11-25-104-rc.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tgh-25-104</object-id></media><media id="d67e1486" orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="tgh-11-25-104-coif.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21037/tgh-25-104</object-id></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all reviewers for their valuable comments.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p><italic toggle="yes">Reporting Checklist:</italic> The authors have completed the STROBE reporting checklist.
