Generally, most cases are not caused by a true urinary tract infection, thus are asymptomatic and do not require treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0001">1</xref>]. However, the presence of a symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI) will cause deterioration of the general condition. Candiduria has the potential to progress into life‐threatening candidemia, such as in patients with urinary system obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0002">2</xref>] and it has been reported that the in‐hospital mortality rate of such patients is significantly higher than that of those without candidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0003">3</xref>]. Multidisciplinary treatment including prompt administration of antifungal drugs is thus required.</p><p>Although rare, fungal UTI can result in fungus ball formation leading to the obstruction of the urinary tract. Subsequent development of urinary retention and hydronephrosis is possible, which may lead to such conditions as pyelonephritis, fungemia, or kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0006">6</xref>].

His medical history included ischemic heart disease, mild dementia, and well‐controlled type II diabetes mellitus (DM), with abiraterone acetate and steroid combination therapy started approximately 1 month earlier for CRPC with multiple lung metastases. Physical findings revealed a temperature of 40° and head abrasions, while a computed tomography (CT) examination of the whole body including head showed no abnormal results. Blood testing indicated mild pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 2700, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 103,000, along with an elevated inflammatory response shown by C‐reactive protein (CRP) at 5.07 mg/dL. Additionally, severe liver dysfunction was shown by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 1243 and 540 IU/L, respectively. Although prothrombin time was prolonged (prothrombin activity 54%, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio 1.4), renal function remained normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.91 mg/dL. A few days prior to falling, a blood test performed the second week after administering abiraterone showed no abnormal results. Based on patient condition, blood test results, and treatment progress, the diagnosis was drug‐induced liver injury caused by abiraterone acetate and he was urgently admitted for treatment.</p><p>Central venous (CV) and urinary catheters were inserted, and the patient was managed in the advanced care unit. The clinical course following admission is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ccr372027-fig-0001">1</xref>. Intravenous fluids and antibiotic treatment with meropenem were immediately administered. However, worsening liver dysfunction was observed, thus steroid pulse therapy was started on the third day after admission. Serum AST and ALT levels increased to a maximum of &gt; 8000 and &gt; 3000 IU/L, respectively. Following the start of treatment, liver enzyme and CRP levels tended to quickly decrease, thus steroid pulse therapy could be terminated within 7 days. On day 11 of hospitalization, laboratory tests showed serum creatinine increased to 2.06 mg/dL, which worsened to 3.98 mg/dL the next day, along with decreased urine output and increased CRP (7.0 mg/dL). Subsequent abdominal non‐contrast CT scanning confirmed bilateral hydronephrosis and showed slightly dense masses at the site of obstruction on both sides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ccr372027-fig-0002">2</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="FIGURE" id="ccr372027-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Clinical course following admission.</p></caption><graphic id="jats-graphic-1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="CCR3-14-e72027-g001.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig><fig fig-type="FIGURE" id="ccr372027-fig-0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Abdominal non‐contrast CT scan images obtained for examination of worsened renal function.

It was possible to place the stent on both sides without resistance, with cloudy urine and a small amount of soft tissue mass observed flowing from the stent. Bilateral hydronephrosis was resolved, though there was no improvement in renal function, suggesting that factors other than postrenal were involved. On hospitalization Day 15, the patient had become nearly anuric and serum creatinine reached 6.10 mg/dL, thus hemodialysis was started. Blood and urine cultures confirmed <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">

</styled-content> growth and intravenous antifungal therapy with fosfluconazole (100 mg on Days 1 and 2, 50 mg thereafter) was started 18 days after admission. The CV catheter was immediately removed and a tip culture performed, with negative results. In addition, chest CT and fundus examinations showed no findings suggestive of fungal infection, while nasal bacterial culture findings were also negative. Based on the clinical course and these findings, it was concluded that a retrograde infection from urine caused candidemia, while the slightly dense masses in both ureters shown by CT were speculated to be fungus balls.</p><p>With every other day hemodialysis and antifungal treatment, serum creatinine and inflammatory parameters gradually decreased, and patient condition showed remarkable improvement. Hemodialysis was completed after 17 sessions and the antifungal drug was switched to oral administration, then stopped on treatment Day 29. During the treatment period, repeated blood cultures revealed disappearance of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">

<italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> fungus balls, formations of fungal hyphae, are typically associated with DM, immunosuppression, chronic disease, or malignancy, except for rare reports of occurrence in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0007">7</xref>]. Once formed, they can cause candidemia due to obstruction of the urinary tract, leading to progression of a fulminant disease with high lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0004">4</xref>]. Furthermore, it should be noted that patients with only one kidney are likely to subsequently experience acute renal dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0005">5</xref>]. In the present case, it is speculated that in addition to DM history, the immune system was weakened by high‐dose steroid administration for drug‐induced liver damage, thus promoting candidemia and fungus ball formation within a short period of time. The possibility of hematogenous spread of candidemia was ruled out based on the CV catheter and sputum culture results, as well as chest CT findings, and it was considered that obstruction of the upper urinary tract by the fungus balls eventually caused candidemia via a urological retrograde infection route. An interesting aspect of this case is their simultaneous bilateral occurrence. Acute renal dysfunction in both kidneys was due to a combination of postrenal factors caused by the fungus balls, as well as others such as infection and general condition deterioration. Only three known cases of renal failure induced by fungal balls in bilateral ureters have been reported including the present while this is the first with subsequent candidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0009">9</xref>].</p><p>Specific imaging results indicating urinary tract fungal balls have not been established as there are very few reported cases, making early diagnosis challenging. Indeed, most previous reports have only noted them as an atypical filling defect showing radiolucency in excretory or retrograde urography findings. In the present case, slightly dense masses in the bilateral ureters were identified by non‐contrast CT, then later diagnosed as fungus balls based on urine culture results. Similarly, Lee reported fungal balls observed in CT images as stone‐like lesions with areas of high attenuation and pointed out that such high‐density findings may be due to deposits on the fungal balls, such as bacterial calcification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0010">10</xref>]. CT findings of fungus balls that mimicked those of urinary stones have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0011">11</xref>]. Notably, Arichi et al. indicated that T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging can be useful for diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0005">5</xref>]. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical course associated with fungal balls along with possible imaging findings is important for prompt diagnosis.</p><p>Fungus balls are generally treated with systemic antifungal drugs, with minimally invasive or surgical removal also sometimes performed. Effectiveness of irrigation of the urinary duct system with amphotericin B has been demonstrated in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0008">8</xref>]. Furthermore, surgery using nephroscopy can be effective for large percutaneous fungus ball removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0012">12</xref>]. Based on clinical data, the infectious Disease Society of America Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Candida suggests that management of patients with <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> UTIs associated with fungus balls can include surgery, systemic antifungals, and amphotericin B irrigation via a nephrostomy tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0013">13</xref>]. Fortunately, those in the present case disappeared, while the resultant urinary tract obstruction was relieved only by systemic administration of antifungal drugs, which may have been due to the small size of the fungal balls or ureteral stent insertion.</p><p>Most fungal infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, can be considered as iatrogenic disease. Drug‐induced liver injury caused by abiraterone acetate, requiring steroid pulse therapy, was thought to be the initial cause of the fungal infection in the present case. Although extremely rare, based on reports of fulminant liver failure due to abiraterone acetate, caution is required in medical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ccr372027-bib-0014">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="ccr372027-sec-0005" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Fungus balls can be easily misdiagnosed as urolithiasis, resulting in delayed or incorrect treatment.
