Standard remission induction therapy combines high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. While effective, cumulative GC exposure drives substantial treatment-related morbidity, including infection, diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular complications, highlighting the urgent need for GC-sparing strategies. Avacopan, an oral selective C5a receptor antagonist, represents a novel therapeutic approach targeting the alternative complement pathway, a key mediator of neutrophil activation and vascular injury in AAV. The pivotal phase 3 ADVOCATE trial demonstrated that avacopan achieved non-inferior remission at 26 weeks and superior sustained remission at 52 weeks compared with a standard GC taper, while reducing GC-related toxicity and improving renal recovery, particularly in patients with advanced kidney impairment. Since approval in 2021, real-world studies and case series have given further confidence in avacopan’s efficacy across diverse patient subgroups, including those with severe renal disease, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and refractory manifestations. However, real-world data also highlight variability in GC tapering practices and safety signals, particularly hepatotoxicity in Japanese cohorts. Several unanswered questions remain, including the long-term safety, clinical benefit of treatment beyond 1 year and optimal GC concomitant use or even the feasibility of complete GC avoidance. Ongoing large-scale studies and international real-world evidence will be essential to define avacopan’s optimal role in clinical practice, ensuring equitable access for patients with AAV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ANCA</kwd><kwd>anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis</kwd><kwd>avacopan</kwd><kwd>real-world evidence</kwd><kwd>vasculitis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION: THE UNMET NEED IN ANTI-NEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODY (ANCA)-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS (AAV) TREATMENT</title><p>AAV encompasses a group of severe, systemic autoimmune conditions, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; this review will focus on GPA and MPA. Renal involvement is a cardinal feature of AAV, affecting up to 80% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>]. Without timely intervention, it carries a high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is associated with significant mortality.</p><p>For many years, remission induction therapy has relied on high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) in combination with either cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab (RTX). While this strategy achieves remission in most patients, the cumulative GC exposure, often exceeding a prednisolone equivalent dose of 3–5 g within the first 6 months, is a major driver of treatment-related morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]. Accordingly, reducing corticosteroid burden has become an important aim of recent trials.</p><p>The PEXIVAS trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT00987389" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT00987389</ext-link>) compared a standard-dose versus a reduced-dose GC regimen in severe AAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. Within the first year of treatment, serious infections occurred in 33% of patients receiving the standard dose and 27.2% of those on the reduced-dose regimen, a statistically significant difference. Importantly, while the cause of infection is multifactorial, the persistence of such a high infection rate in the reduced-dose group underscores the significant risk that continues despite substantially reduced GC exposure. The LoVAS trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02198248" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT02198248</ext-link>) evaluated an even lower starting dose of prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) in combination with RTX; while the low-dose regimen was associated with fewer adverse events, serious infections still occurred in 7.2% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. These findings highlight that even substantially reduced GC exposure continues to confer significant risk.</p><p>Beyond infection, GC-related toxicity is significant. Within 1 year of diagnosis in those participating in the European Vasculitis Society trials, 8% suffered new-onset diabetes (event rate 9.4/100 patient-years). Fractures (2.5%) due to accelerated bone mineral density loss, avascular necrosis (0.4%), peptic ulceration (2.6%), cataracts (2%) and severe neuropsychiatric effects including psychosis and long-term cardiovascular risk factors were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. Notably, even in the reduced-dose GC arm of the LoVAS trial, the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus was 13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. These toxicities not only increase mortality but also cause irreversible damage and reduced quality of life. This underscores the urgency of developing effective steroid-sparing regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>THE ADVENT OF AVACOPAN: TARGETING THE COMPLEMENT PATHWAY</title><p>AAV-associated glomerulonephritis is histopathologically characterised as ‘pauci-immune’ due to the scarcity of immunoglobulin and complement deposits. Immunopathogenesis is driven by autoantibodies targeting neutrophil proteins—specifically proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO)—which trigger aberrant neutrophil activation and a destructive, pro-inflammatory cascade, culminating in necrotising vasculitis and severe end-organ damage. More recently, experimental models have firmly established a pathogenic role for the alternative complement pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>]. Mice lacking the C5a receptor (C5aR1) are protected from disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>], while pharmacological blockade of C5a ameliorates necrotising glomerulonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>]. Further studies showed no evidence of involvement of the classical or lectin pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11–13</xref>]. Detailed analyses of human renal biopsy specimens further support this important role of the alternative pathway activation, revealing deposition of complement components including C3c, C3d, C4d, C5b-9 and factor B. This deposition is associated with higher proteinuria and poorer kidney function at diagnosis compared with patients with minimal or no deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14–19</xref>].</p><p>The alternative pathway acts as a self-amplifying loop of inflammation. A triggering insult induces cytokine (e.g. tumour necrosis factor-α) release, which primes neutrophils and promotes translocation of ANCA autoantigens (MPO and PR3) to the cell surface. Circulating ANCA immunoglobulin G binds these antigens, activating neutrophils and leading to degranulation, production of reactive oxygen species and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Activated neutrophils also release mediators that activate complement, including properdin, which stabilises C3 convertase and accelerates alternative pathway activity. This cascade generates C5a, a potent chemoattractant and neutrophil priming factor, perpetuating a feed-forward loop of neutrophil recruitment, vascular injury and inflammation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20–24</xref>]. Clinically, this is reflected by elevated circulating complement activation fragments Bb, C3a, C5a and sC5b-9 during active disease compared with remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>].</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Complement-mediated pathophysiology model of AAV.</p></caption><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="sfaf388fig1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig><p>This mechanistic insight provided the rationale for selectively targeting the C5a–C5aR axis. Avacopan is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule selective antagonist of C5aR. By competitively inhibiting the C5a–C5aR interaction, avacopan effectively abrogates this critical amplification loop. Crucially, avacopan spares the terminal complement pathway and formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9), thereby preserving host defence against encapsulated bacteria. This targeted approach offers the potential to control disease activity while avoiding GC toxicities.</p><p>Clinical evaluation of avacopan began with two phase 2 randomised controlled trials. The C5a Receptor Inhibitor Avacopan in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (CLEAR) trial demonstrated that avacopan reduced GC use while maintaining effective disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>], including 22 patients who received no steroids. The Adjunctive Treatment with Avacopan in Patients with ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (CLASSIC) trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of avacopan as an adjunct to standard treatment, establishing 30 mg twice daily as the optimal dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>]. These studies laid the foundation for the pivotal ADVOCATE trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT02994927" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT02994927</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>THE ADVOCATE TRIAL</title><p>The ADVOCATE trial was a global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 3 study enrolling 331 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GPA or MPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>]. Participants received either avacopan (30 mg twice daily for 52 weeks) plus placebo prednisone or a tapering course of prednisone over 20 weeks plus placebo avacopan. All participants received standard induction immunosuppression with RTX or CYC.</p><p>The co-primary efficacy endpoints were achieving remission at week 26, defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 and no GC use in the 4 weeks prior to assessment and sustained remission at week 52, defined as remission at both week 26 and week 52, with no relapse between these points and no GC use for vasculitis in the 4 weeks preceding week 52. The mean cumulative prednisone-equivalent dose of oral and intravenous GCs over 52 weeks was 1676 mg in the avacopan group and 3487 mg in the prednisone group.</p><p>Both primary endpoints were met. At week 26 remission was achieved in 72.3% of patients in the avacopan group compared with 70.1% in the prednisone group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001 for non-inferiority). By week 52, the avacopan regimen achieved sustained remission in 65.7% of patients in the avacopan group and 54.9% in the prednisolone group (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .007 for superiority), suggesting avacopan is more efficacious in sustaining remission.</p><p>However, interpretation requires caution. In the ADVOCATE trial, prednisolone was fully withdrawn by 21 weeks while avacopan was continued through week 52. This contrasts with real-world clinical practice, where steroid therapy typically continues for at least a year or longer. In addition, patients receiving RTX induction had no maintenance therapy, which differs from standard clinical practice. Notably, the superiority of avacopan was most pronounced in those who received RTX induction, with 71% of patients in the avacopan group and 56% of prednisolone-treated patients achieving sustained remission at 52 weeks. The trial was limited to 52 weeks of follow-up and excluded important severe manifestations of AAV, including those with eGFR &lt;15 ml/min and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. No children were included in the study.</p><p>Overall, the ADVOCATE trial established avacopan as an effective GC-sparing agent for remission induction, with some evidence for improved disease control over 1 year. However, the superiority for sustained remission at 52 weeks may be partly attributable to the trial design, which compared 52 weeks of avacopan against a protocolised 20-week prednisone taper with no subsequent steroid therapy beyond this time, and no maintenance immunosuppressive therapy was given in those receiving RTX induction therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Safety profile</title><p>Avacopan was associated with significantly less GC-related toxicity at both 26 and 52 weeks, as measured by the validated Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>]. This composite score integrates the incidence and severity of a broad range of steroid-related adverse effects, enabling longitudinal and standardised assessment across trials.</p><p>Serious adverse events were similar between groups (42.4% avacopan versus 45.5% prednisone), including serious infection. Avacopan’s mechanism of action, which preserves the terminal complement pathway, was not associated with the infection risks typically seen with terminal complement blockade. Liver dysfunction occurred more frequently with avacopan (5.4% versus 3.7%), although these cases resolved after discontinuation of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Focus on renal outcomes</title><p>Renal recovery was a key benefit.

A post hoc analysis of 50 patients with a baseline eGFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> suggested even greater improvement in this high-risk group (16.1 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> with avacopan versus +7.7 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> with prednisone; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .003).

Most studies were small, with the number of avacopan-treated patients ranging from 8 to 92, and treatment regimens varied across regions but included patient subgroups excluded from the ADVOCATE trial. Most of these studies also relied on data obtained through compassionate use programs, rapid access initiatives and early post-marketing surveillance. While these sources provide valuable insights, they are inherently prone to selection bias and confounding, necessitating cautious interpretation of the findings.

Guidelines on GC tapering and withdrawal when used with avacopan are inconsistent. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines have not specified GC tapering protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref>], while both the British Society for Rheumatology and Canadian Vasculitis Research Network guidelines recommend aiming to complete GC withdrawal by 4 weeks of avacopan initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref>].

Knowing the extent to which GC exposure can be safely minimised in combination with avacopan is a key consideration. Currently unpublished data from our own centre in Birmingham, UK suggest that a minimal GC dosing protocol (oral prednisolone 30 mg for 1 week followed by 20 mg for 1 week) together with avacopan and RTX or CYC can deliver equivalent clinical outcomes compared with a standard-dose GC treatment regimen without avacopan, in terms of sustained remission rates at 12 months, eGFR improvement and safety (presented in abstract form at the 21st International Vasculitis Workshop, Barcelona 2024).</p><p>The above discrepancies in GC usage with avacopan may reflect limited physician awareness, lack of standardized follow-up visits, delays in drug approval processes and higher GC dependency in relapsing and refractory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37–39</xref>]. Most current evidence comes from early post-approval data. As avacopan becomes more widely integrated into clinical practice and guideline recommendations are updated, patterns of GC tapering and dependency may evolve accordingly and realise the GC avoidance benefits demonstrated in the ADVOCATE trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Safety and adverse outcomes</title><p>Thirteen studies reported safety outcomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32–44</xref>].

Between 2023 and 2025, nine case reports of avacopan-associated DILI were published, eight originating from Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>]. These findings align with an ADVOCATE subgroup analysis that reported liver function test (LFT) derangement in 27.3% of Japanese patients treated with avacopan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref>].

The long-term clinical and safety outcomes of avacopan remain uncertain. Only three real-world studies have reported a follow-up duration &gt;1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>]. In a study by Eisinger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>], 15 patients received avacopan for a median of 100 weeks (interquartile range 29) with a relapse rate of 6.7%, sustained eGFR improvement and no TEAEs. Draibe <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>] similarly described four patients taking avacopan for 12–18 months. While these early findings suggest durable safety and efficacy, larger datasets are needed. Ongoing studies will address this question: AVACOSTAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT05897684" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT05897684</ext-link>), a large post-authorization safety study, compares long-term patient outcomes between avacopan and other treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">88</xref>], while AVAC-EUR (<ext-link ext-link-type="pmc:clinical-trial" xlink:href="NCT06794827" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NCT06794827</ext-link>), a retrospective observational study, compares clinical and adverse outcomes between patients with AAV who received avacopan for &lt;1 year and &gt;1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref>].</p><p>The optimal GC taper in combination with avacopan remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref>]. Concern persists that shorter GC courses may be associated with higher relapse rates, particularly after avacopan withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">91</xref>]. No consensus currently exists on the minimal cumulative GC dose required or whether complete avoidance is feasible. In an international survey of 210 clinicians, 41.8% of survey respondents expressed interest in a GC minimisation trial with avacopan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the phase 2 CLEAR trial reported a treatment arm with avacopan and no prednisolone that demonstrated non-inferior response rates at 12 weeks compared with standard regimens (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 22/67; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>]; however, real-world experience remains limited. Gabilan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>] reported complete remission in 13% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4/31) of patients treated with avacopan and standard induction remission therapy without any concomitant GC use, whereas Kubota <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>] failed to induce remission in five minor relapses using avacopan monotherapy. All studies were limited by small patient numbers and further research is needed.</p><p>Finally, there remains a paucity of real-world data on the cost-effectiveness and barriers to avacopan use in AAV treatment across different geographical regions. A cost–utility analysis conducted in the UK estimated that avacopan combined with RTX or CYC yielded an incremental cost:utility ratio of £19 615 per additional quality-adjusted life year gained and was considered cost-effective, leading to approval by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">92</xref>]. Comparable analyses in Canada and Spain have also reported cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">94</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is likely that access to avacopan remains unequal between and within countries, influenced by national healthcare systems, drug pricing and reimbursement policies. It has been suggested that patients with active severe AAV at greatest risk of GC toxicity and those with disease refractory to other induction treatments should be prioritised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref>], although the evidence of use in both the ADVOCATE trial and real-world data in these subgroups is less robust, as described in the previous sections. Future research should therefore investigate healthcare system–related barriers, regional cost-effectiveness, clinician knowledge and experience gaps and patient-specific obstacles. Such work will be crucial to ensuring equitable access to avacopan and reducing disparities in AAV care.</p><p>In summary, avacopan represents a paradigm shift in the management of AAV, offering an effective GC-sparing alternative. Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate its ability to achieve and sustain remission, reduce steroid-related toxicity and improve renal outcomes, including in patients with advanced kidney disease or other severe manifestations. Despite its promise, gaps remain regarding long-term safety, optimal GC minimisation strategies, cost-effectiveness and use in special populations. Ongoing studies and accumulating real-world experience will be crucial to defining avacopan’s optimal role in clinical practice and ensuring equitable access for patients worldwide.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>No specific funding was received for the preparation of this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>C.P.C. and A.H. were responsible for the original manuscript preparation.
