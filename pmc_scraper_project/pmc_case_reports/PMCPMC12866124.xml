While liver stiffness measurement (LSM) has emerged as a valuable non-invasive assessment tool, its clinical utility and associated factors in AILD populations remain incompletely characterized, particularly in understudied ethnic populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This cross-sectional study enrolled 200 participants from January 2023 to January 2024, comprising 79 patients with AILD and 121 healthy controls from two tertiary hospitals in Kashgar region. All participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, biochemical evaluation, and LSM using transient elastography. Fibrosis staging in the AILD cohort was performed using a composite clinical algorithm incorporating clinical manifestations of portal hypertension, ultrasonographic features, biochemical indices, and available histopathology (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 23, 29.1%). Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify factors independently associated with LSM values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Patients with AILD demonstrated significantly elevated LSM compared to controls (13.7 vs. 5.6 kPa, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with marked female predominance (83.5% vs. 47.9%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). LSM demonstrated a strong correlation with the clinically defined fibrosis stage, with values progressively increasing from stage S1 (10.2 kPa) to S4 (19.8 kPa). Multivariable analysis identified fibrosis stage (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.003) and direct bilirubin (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.045) as independent predictors of LSM values, whereas albumin demonstrated a strong inverse correlation (ρ=-0.67, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in LSM were observed across the AILD subtypes after adjusting for the fibrosis stage (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.36).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">LSM is strongly associated with clinically defined disease severity in patients with AILD. Integration with clinical parameters, including hepatic synthetic function and cholestatic markers, may enhance its clinical utility. However, validation against histological staging and in diverse populations is required before definitive conclusions regarding diagnostic accuracy can be made.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12876-025-04577-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Autoimmune liver disease</kwd><kwd>Liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>Transient elastography</kwd><kwd>Liver stiffness measurement</kwd><kwd>Clinical staging</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic accuracy</kwd><kwd>Non-invasive assessment</kwd><kwd>Autoimmune hepatitis</kwd><kwd>Primary biliary cholangitis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">AILD encompasses a spectrum of chronic inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, collectively affecting approximately 1–2% of the global population, with significant regional variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These disorders are characterized by immune-mediated hepatocellular injury and progressive fibrosis, ultimately leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma if left untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Pathogenesis involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and dysregulated immune responses, resulting in chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The degree of hepatic fibrosis is the most critical prognostic indicator of AILD, directly correlating with clinical outcomes, treatment response, and long-term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Traditional assessment methods have relied on liver biopsy, which is considered the historical gold standard for fibrosis evaluation. However, this invasive procedure carries inherent risks, including bleeding, infection, and sampling variability, with studies demonstrating up to 20% discordance in staging between different biopsy samples from the same patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, patient acceptance remains limited because of procedural discomfort and anxiety, necessitating the development of reliable, non-invasive alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Transient elastography, commercially available as FibroScan, has emerged as the most extensively validated non-invasive method for hepatic fibrosis assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This ultrasound-based technique measures liver stiffness by quantifying the velocity of shear waves propagating through the hepatic tissue, with values expressed in kilopascals that correlate directly with fibrosis severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Multiple large-scale studies have established its diagnostic accuracy for viral hepatitis and metabolic liver diseases, with area under the curve values exceeding 0.85 for advanced fibrosis detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the performance characteristics of LSMin in autoimmune liver disease populations remain poorly characterized, with limited data from specific ethnic groups and geographic regions.</p><p id="Par8">Several factors may influence LSM beyond the severity of fibrosis, including active inflammation, cholestasis, hepatic congestion, and patient-related variables such as obesity and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In AILD, the chronic inflammatory milieu and frequent cholestatic features may particularly impact measurement accuracy, potentially leading to an overestimation of fibrosis severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Understanding these confounding factors is essential for the optimal clinical interpretation and application of LSM in routine practice.</p><p id="Par9">The Kashgar population has a distinct genetic background and unique environmental characteristics that may influence AILD presentation and clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between LSM and clinically defined disease severity across different fibrosis stages in patients with AILD from this population, while identifying clinical and biochemical factors associated with the measurement values.

This finding aligns with previous observations that extrahepatic cholestasis can increase liver stiffness values, irrespective of fibrosis severity, and has practical implications for clinicians interpreting LSM in patients with significant cholestasis, where values might overestimate fibrosis severity due to bile duct inflammation and edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Our cutoff values (S3:12.0 kPa, S4:15.3 kPa) demonstrate reasonable concordance with those reported in the systematic review by Chen et al. examining transient elastography specifically in AILD populations (F3:9.6–12.5 kPa, F4:14.4–16.9 kPa for primary biliary cholangitis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This concordance provides external support for the potential clinical utility of the observed thresholds, although disease- and population-specific validation remains essential.</p><p id="Par76">The profound correlation between liver stiffness and albumin levels (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=-0.67) highlights the close relationship between architectural changes and hepatic synthetic function. This association strengthens the evidence supporting LSM as a comprehensive marker of liver disease severity, encompassing both structural and functional aspects of hepatic impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The consistency of this relationship across different autoimmune liver disease subtypes suggests universal biological mechanisms linking fibrosis progression with protein synthesis capacity, independent of the specific disease pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">The demographic characteristics of our autoimmune liver disease cohort, particularly the marked female predominance (83.5%) and older age at presentation, align with the established epidemiological patterns reported globally for AIH (female: male ratio 3.6:1) and primary biliary cholangitis (female: male ratio 9:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The absence of significant differences in LSM across disease subtypes after fibrosis adjustment supports the potential universal applicability across the AILD spectrum, although the sample sizes within individual subgroups (AIH, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18; PBC, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 47; overlap syndromes, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14) limit confidence in disease-specific conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">Several methodological strengths enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of our findings. Rigorous standardization of LSM procedures, including operator training and quality control metrics, ensures measurement reliability and reproducibility consistent with established guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Comprehensive biochemical evaluation provides a detailed characterization of liver dysfunction patterns. The excellent inter-operator reliability (ICC 0.94) and high technical success rate (98.5%) support the measurement validity. The inclusion of healthy controls establishes clear baseline thresholds and validates the ability to discriminate between diseased and normal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">This study has several limitations. First, the absence of a universal histological confirmation is fundamental. Our composite clinical staging, while reflecting real-world practice, requires validation through histopathological analysis. Second, the cross-sectional design precludes conclusions regarding the utility of LSM in monitoring disease progression or treatment response. Third, inflammatory activity may confound LSM interpretation, potentially causing an overestimation of fibrosis severity in patients with active flares. Fourth, the single-region recruitment from the Kashgar population limits the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Fifth, modest subgroup sample sizes (AIH, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18; overlap syndromes, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14) limit disease-specific conclusions. Sixth, the exclusion of decompensated patients and those with severe obesity restricts the applicability to clinically stable populations.</p><p id="Par80">The clinical implementation of LSM values should consider cholestatic markers, particularly direct bilirubin levels. The strong correlation with albumin suggests that LSM provides complementary information to traditional biochemical markers.</p><p id="Par81">Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies assessing LSM changes during treatment response and disease course, providing insights into the utility of serial measurements for monitoring therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A systematic correlation with histological staging across diverse AILD populations would establish definitive diagnostic accuracy and optimal cutoff values. Investigation of LSM performance in different ethnic populations would enhance the understanding of population-specific considerations for clinical implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The development of AILD-specific diagnostic algorithms incorporating LSM with other non-invasive biomarkers, such as the enhanced liver fibrosis score or FibroTest, could further optimize clinical utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par82">This cross-sectional study of 79 patients with AILD and 121 controls from the Kashgar region demonstrated that LSM was strongly associated with clinically defined disease severity, with values progressively increasing across fibrosis stages. Fibrosis stage and direct bilirubin levels emerged as independent predictors of LSM, whereas albumin levels showed a strong inverse correlation (ρ=-0.67). LSM performance was consistent across the AILD subtypes after adjustment for the fibrosis stage.</p><p id="Par83">These findings support the use of LSM as a promising non-invasive tool for characterizing the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with AILD. However, the lack of universal histological confirmation represents a critical limitation. Before clinical implementation, validation against histopathological staging in multicenter studies across diverse populations is essential. The integration of LSM with clinical and biochemical parameters may optimize the assessment of disease severity in this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
