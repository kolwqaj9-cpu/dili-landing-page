A rare and severe case of liver failure caused by babesiosis and Lyme disease without typical symptoms
</p><p>Babesiosis and Lyme disease are tick-bourne infections transmitted by Ixodes ticks and are increasingly prevalent in the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. While each pathogen independently can cause systemic illness, co-infection is not uncommon and may present with overlapping or atypical features, complicating timely diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of a 70 year old man who presented to the hospital with dyspnea, dry cough and leg edema. Initial workup supported acute decompensated heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome. Despite appropriate diuresis and supportive care, the patient rapidly developed oliguric renal failure requiring dialysis, hepatic encephalopathy and fulminant acute liver failure (ALF) with severe coagulopathy and shock. Notably, he lacked classic features of tick-bourne illness during presentation, such as fever, rash, hemolysis. Broad spectrum empiric antibiotics were initiated, including doxycycline, but the patient deteriorated and died on hospital day five. Postmortem testing revealed Babesia microti (2, 4% parasitemia) and Borrelia Burgdorferi by PCP testing, confirming tick-bourne co-infection. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of atypical presentations of endemic zoonoses. Although hepatic involvement in babesiosis is recognized, fulminant ALF remains rare. Lyme disease is typically associated with mild, transient LFT elevations and has not been linked to ALF. The patient’s clinical decline may reflect the additive effect of Babesia induced multiorgan failure. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for tick-bourne infections, even in the absence of hallmark features in endemic regions, particularly when faced with unexplained multiorgan failure. Early recognition and empiric therapy is imperative to improve outcome in similar cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>acute liver failure</kwd><kwd>babesiosis</kwd><kwd>co-infection</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>Lyme disease</kwd><kwd>multiorgan failure</kwd><kwd>tick-borne diseases</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-20499361261416190"><title>Background</title><p>Babesiosis and Lyme disease are emerging tick-borne infections transmitted by Ixodes ticks.

Babesiosis, caused by the protozoan parasite <italic toggle="yes">Babesia microti</italic>, primarily affects erythrocytes and leads to hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatitis, pneumonia, and, in rare cases, splenic infarct and rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-20499361261416190">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-20499361261416190"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-20499361261416190">3</xref></sup> Babesiosis is particularly severe in elderly and immunocompromised patients.<sup>

</sup> Based on the most recent data from the IDSA 2020 Guideline on Diagnosis and Management of Babesiosis, co-infection is not uncommon: in endemic areas, 2%–40% of patients with early Lyme disease have babesiosis, and up to half of babesiosis cases have concurrent Lyme disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-20499361261416190">8</xref>
</sup> Co-infected patients frequently exhibit more severe constitutional symptoms, such as persistent fever and fatigue, and more pronounced laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia, compared with Lyme disease alone.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Hepatic involvement, and in particular fulminant ALF, is an exceptionally rare complication in babesiosis and thus far has not been reported as a complication of Lyme disease.

He presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of worsening dyspnea, dry cough, and bilateral lower extremity edema. His medications included insulin, aspirin, metoprolol, and torsemide. The cough was nonproductive and worsened in the supine position. The edema was symmetric, nontender, and without erythema. The dyspnea was exertional and orthopneic, without chest pain. The patient denied fever, chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting.</p><p>On admission, his vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, a heart rate of 98 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Physical examination was notable for signs of volume overload, including elevated jugular venous distention, pulmonary crackles, and 3+ bilateral pitting edema. The skin examination did not show any rashes or evidence of cellulitis. Chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and pleural effusions, without lobar infiltrates. Laboratory testing showed an elevated pro-BNP (blood urea nitrogen) and a serum creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL, up from a baseline of 2.5 mg/dL. Electrolytes and liver enzymes were within normal limits on admission. Complete blood cell count showed stable chronic normocytic anemia consistent with anemia of chronic kidney disease, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-20499361261416190">Table 1</xref>.

He was unable to provide further history due to encephalopathy that developed despite adequate hemodialysis. Workup for acute viral hepatitis was negative. Ischemic hepatitis was ruled out due to the absence of hypotension and shock. Drug-induced liver injury was deemed unlikely, as no new medication was started, and the insulin, torsemide, and metoprolol the patient was receiving had been well tolerated in the past and have a low risk for hepatotoxicity. Abdominal ultrasound and Doppler studies excluded cholecystitis and biliary obstruction and confirmed patent portal and hepatic veins. Urinalysis could not be obtained as the patient became anuric. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction, normal valvular function, and absence of pericardial effusion or tamponade.</p><p>As the patient’s condition deteriorated, signs of sepsis and hypotension emerged on day 3 of hospitalization (48–72 h after admission). Empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily, vancomycin (renally dosed 15 mg/kg/day), and doxycycline 100 mg IV every 12 h was initiated for community-acquired sepsis without a clear source. His hypotension worsened, and he developed shock, requiring inotropic support with norepinephrine, vasopressin, phenylephrine, and dobutamine.

It is classified by the O’Grady criteria into hyperacute (&lt;7 days), acute (7–28 days), and subacute (28 days–12 weeks) presentations. The etiology of ALF varies geographically: viral hepatitis (particularly hepatitis A and E) is the leading cause in under-resourced regions, while drug-induced liver injury (DILI), most commonly from acetaminophen, predominates in developed countries. Complementary and alternative medicines and anti-tuberculosis drugs are major causes in parts of Asia. Other less frequent causes include ischemia, Budd–Chiari syndrome, herpes viruses, Wilson’s disease, malignancy, and pregnancy-related conditions. Etiology significantly influences prognosis; ALF due to acetaminophen, viral hepatitis A, and pregnancy-related causes tends to have better outcomes, while idiosyncratic DILI, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and hepatitis B are associated with higher mortality and a higher likelihood of requiring liver transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-20499361261416190">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-20499361261416190">13</xref></sup></p><p>Acute liver failure in severe babesiosis results from a combination of hemolysis-induced hepatocellular injury, microvascular obstruction, and inflammatory cytokine-mediated damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-20499361261416190">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-20499361261416190">15</xref></sup> While ALF caused by <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> has been rarely documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-20499361261416190">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-20499361261416190">17</xref></sup> ALF in a patient co-infected with <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> has not been reported thus far.

</sup> reported no ALF cases linked to <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> co-infection.</p><p>Hepatic involvement in Lyme disease is generally mild and subclinical, with elevated liver enzymes seen more frequently in early disseminated disease (66%) than in localized disease (34%).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-20499361261416190">19</xref>
</sup> In early disseminated disease, mildly elevated liver enzymes, particularly gamma-glutamyl transferase and ALT, are relatively common, occurring in up to 66% of patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-20499361261416190">19</xref>
</sup> These abnormalities are generally transient and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Benedix et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-20499361261416190">19</xref>
</sup> described a patient with multiple erythema migrans due to <italic toggle="yes">B. afzelii</italic>, who had mild hepatitis and hepatomegaly, both of which improved following treatment with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Similarly, a prospective study conducted by Nadelman et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-20499361261416190">20</xref>
</sup> found that 37% of patients with culture-confirmed <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> had hepatitis, but none developed clinically significant liver disease, particularly ALF. In addition, isolated elevations in AST may reflect Lyme-associated myositis rather than true hepatic injury, according to some studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-20499361261416190">21</xref>
</sup> Although rare cases of clinically significant hepatitis have been reported, such as the case described by Duffau et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-20499361261416190">22</xref>
</sup> involving <italic toggle="yes">B. garinii</italic> in an immunocompromised patient, these are exceptionally rare and do not cause acute liver failure. Given the typically benign hepatic involvement in Lyme disease and the fact that the patient received ceftriaxone and doxycycline, both of which would treat Lyme disease, it is unlikely that Lyme infection alone accounted for the ALF in our case. More likely, ALF was part of severe babesiosis, which is known to be life-threatening in older patients with comorbidities such as the patient we report.</p><p>This case highlights an unusual, severe, life-threatening, and atypical presentation of an endemic infection and the diagnostic complexity in cases of co-infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic>. The co-infection rate of <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> across the United States is 42%,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-20499361261416190">18</xref>
</sup> while it is 37% in Wisconsin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-20499361261416190">10</xref>
</sup> These findings differ from an earlier study based in the Northeast region of the United States, where the co-infection rate was as low as 10%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-20499361261416190">7</xref>
</sup> The mortality rate from babesiosis ranges from 1.6% to 13%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-20499361261416190">18</xref>
</sup> It is even higher, up to 20%, for hospitalized patients who are immunocompromised or who contracted babesiosis through blood transfusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-20499361261416190">1</xref>
</sup> The most recent retrospective study reported an overall 90-day mortality rate of 1.4% across the United States and noted it to be lower in the <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> co-infection group than in isolated babesiosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-20499361261416190">18</xref>
</sup></p><p>In animal models, co-infection has been shown to exacerbate the severity of Lyme disease, with the hypothesis that babesiosis could cause suppression of adaptive immunity, thereby exacerbating Lyme disease symptoms by altering the host’s immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-20499361261416190">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-20499361261416190">11</xref></sup> However, other studies in humans demonstrated no such risk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-20499361261416190">18</xref>
</sup></p><p>The severity of babesiosis depends on host immunity and the degree of parasitemia. It ranges from asymptomatic mild infection to moderate or severe infection. Severe disease is seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with asplenia, B-cell–associated lymphoid malignancy, and patients on B-cell–depleting therapies such as rituximab, or those with high parasitemia &gt;10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-20499361261416190">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-20499361261416190">23</xref></sup> A high degree of parasitemia can cause hemolytic anemia and its complications. In addition, a cytokine storm due to an inappropriately intense immune response to high parasitemia can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-20499361261416190">1</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, in cases of splenic complications such as splenic rupture and infarction, disease severity does not depend on host immune status or parasitemia level; in fact, most cases of splenic rupture are seen in young, healthy males with a low parasitemia index.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-20499361261416190">3</xref>
</sup></p><p>This case emphasizes specific diagnostic challenges inherent to <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic>. Because the patient initially lacked fever, hemolysis, cytopenias, or a reported tick exposure, babesiosis was not considered as a trigger for CHF exacerbation. Diagnosis of babesiosis relies heavily on peripheral blood smear microscopy, which has limited sensitivity at low parasitemia. Parasitemia levels below 1%–2% are frequently missed, as <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> organisms are extremely small, requiring examination of at least 300 microscopic fields under oil immersion to achieve adequate detection. Even at 2%–3% (as reported in this case), organisms may be overlooked due to their small size, morphologic similarity to artifacts, and the technical demands of microscopic examination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-20499361261416190">8</xref>
</sup> PCR (including real-time and 18S rRNA reverse transcriptase PCR) offers significantly higher sensitivity and specificity but is not always readily available, may require send-out processing, and often has a turnaround time that delays confirmation in real-world clinical settings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-20499361261416190">8</xref>
</sup></p><p>Cardiac complications are a significant and underrecognized feature of severe babesiosis, occurring in nearly 20% of hospitalized patients, as shown in a retrospective study of 163 adults at Yale–New Haven Hospital between 2011 and 2021.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-20499361261416190">24</xref>
</sup> The most common cardiac manifestations included atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, QTc interval prolongation, and type 2 myocardial infarction, and these occur independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors or preexisting cardiac disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-20499361261416190">24</xref>
</sup> We believe that in our case, babesiosis was a trigger for acute decompensated HFpEF and that it was the first sign of infection, despite the initial absence of fever, cytopenia, and hemolysis.</p><p>Babesiosis-induced AKI is typically seen in the context of hemolysis and cast nephropathy. However, in this case, it was unlikely, as it presented early in the absence of significant hemolysis. A case reported by Luciano et al. described a patient with severe babesiosis and AKI in the absence of typical heme pigment–induced nephropathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-20499361261416190">2</xref>
</sup> Urine microscopy revealed the novel finding of large urinary macrophages phagocytosing infected erythrocytes, raising suspicion for an inflammatory renal process. This case illustrates that <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> may precipitate AKI via infection-triggered immune mechanisms, including interstitial inflammation, even in the absence of severe hemolysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-20499361261416190">2</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, due to oliguria, urinalysis could not be obtained in our patient. We speculate that acute interstitial nephritis was the primary cause of AKI in this patient, as he did not have hemolytic anemia nor a high degree of parasitemia, making hemolysis a less likely cause. Lyme disease is not recognized as a cause of AKI.</p><p>Finally, it is important to address Lyme disease in this case. The diagnosis in our patient was confirmed by a blood PCR assay detecting <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s. DNA, which was ordered as part of a tick-borne disease evaluation in light of diagnostic uncertainty at the time of patient decompensation. A positive blood PCR for <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> DNA is diagnostic of active infection. Our patient also tested positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies are markers of early infection, whereas IgG antibodies may be positive due to prior exposure, particularly since the patient lived in an endemic area with a high incidence of Lyme disease and may have had a previous infection. The seroprevalence of IgG in individuals residing in highly endemic areas—such as the county where our patient lived—can be as high as 15%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-20499361261416190">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-20499361261416190">25</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section4-20499361261416190"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This case highlights co-infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. burgdorferi</italic> presenting atypically with multiorgan failure, including fatal fulminant ALF.
