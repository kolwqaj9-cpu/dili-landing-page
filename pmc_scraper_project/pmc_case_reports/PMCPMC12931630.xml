This study aimed to develop a mechanistic model for assessing hyperbilirubinemia risk using genetic markers. We developed an ordinary differential equation (ODE)‐based mechanistic model of human bilirubin metabolism, incorporating key processes such as unconjugated bilirubin synthesis, hepatic uptake, conjugation to form conjugated bilirubin, and elimination via hepatic and renal pathways. The model includes key transporters and enzymes like OATP1B1, MRP2, MRP3, and UGT1A1 involved in bilirubin metabolism. The model was parametrized using in vitro and published human data, validated in healthy subjects and genetic disease cases, and assessed for genetic mutations' impact on bilirubin levels. A 90% reduction in OATP1B1 enzymatic activity increased predicted unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin concentrations (1.58‐fold and 2.2‐fold, respectively), mimicking data from individuals with mutations in OATP1B1. Sensitivity analysis of OATP1B1, MRP2, and UGT1A1 revealed increased OATP1B1 sensitivity in the presence of low UGT1A1 activity. Model simulations linked nilotinib‐induced hyperbilirubinemia to UGT1A1 mutations, and simulations were used to assess the risk of hyperbilirubinemia associated with varying doses of nelfinavir, atazanavir, and TAK‐875, based on their off‐target effects on transporters. Results demonstrated that uncertainty in free drug tissue concentration may be crucial in hyperbilirubinemia, especially for highly protein‐bound drugs. This approach may help assess hyperbilirubinemia risk using a drug's inhibitory in vitro data coupled with patient pharmacogenetic data for OATP1B1, UGT1A1, and MRP2 mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="psp470037-kwd-0001">hyperbilirubinemia</kwd><kwd id="psp470037-kwd-0002">MRP2</kwd><kwd id="psp470037-kwd-0003">MRP3</kwd><kwd id="psp470037-kwd-0004">OATP1B1</kwd><kwd id="psp470037-kwd-0005">UGT1A1</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="6900"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 2026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.7.1 mode:remove_FC converted:24.02.2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group id="psp470037-ntgp-0001"><fn fn-type="funding" id="psp470037-note-0001"><p>

It can indicate either hepatic impairment of bilirubin elimination or extrahepatic conditions, such as hemolysis. In cases of drug‐induced liver injury (DILI), hyperbilirubinemia serves as an important indicator of liver dysfunction but should always be interpreted alongside alanine aminotransferase (ALT). According to Hy's Law and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for industry on premarketing clinical evaluations, hyperbilirubinemia exceeding twice the upper limit of normal (ULN), when accompanied by ALT elevations greater than three times the ULN and in the absence of other causes, is a key criterion for diagnosing DILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0001">1</xref>]. The severity of hyperbilirubinemia is classified by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) into four grades based on increases in total blood bilirubin: Grade 1 for levels above 1.5 times the ULN, Grade 2 for levels between 1.5 and 3.0 times the ULN, Grade 3 for levels between 3.0 and 10 times the ULN, and Grade 4 for levels exceeding 10 times the ULN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0002">2</xref>]. Drug treatment is generally discontinued when a drug‐related elevation reaches Grade 3 or higher.</p><p>Hyperbilirubinemia is a frequent adverse effect associated with a wide range of medications, including antibiotics, anti‐inflammatory drugs, immunomodulators, CNS agents, musculoskeletal agents, and dietary supplements. It is commonly observed in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments such as cytarabine, as well as in those receiving targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is particularly important in the management of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, total blood bilirubin serves as a marker in liver function tests and is associated with the alterations in drug metabolism enzymes, including UGT1A1 and OATP1B1. It also serves as a marker for disease progression in indications such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0005">5</xref>].</p><p>Systems toxicology is an integrative approach that assesses drug‐induced toxicity by employing computational tools to understand the perturbations of biological networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0006">6</xref>]. Previous systems pharmacology studies primarily focused on evaluating drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia in both preclinical and human settings, with the aim of informing preclinical and early clinical drug development processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0008">8</xref>]. The present work seeks to use biosimulation to identify factors responsible for interindividual variations in drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia, with the goal of improving personalized toxicity assessment.</p><p>The current study aimed to enhance the understanding of drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia through (1) the development of a mechanistic model of human bilirubin metabolism; (2) the exploration of the roles of hepatic transporters, specifically OATP and MRP2, as well as the enzyme UGT1A1; (3) the examination of the UGT1A1 polymorphism as a potential risk factor for drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia; and (4) the assessment of the toxicity risk of common drugs, including nilotinib, nelfinavir, atazanavir, and TAK875, using the developed mechanistic model.</p></sec><sec id="psp470037-sec-0005" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="psp470037-sec-0006"><label>2.1</label><title>Model Description</title><p>A mechanistic model was developed consisting of synthesis and elimination processes involving four biological compartments: Blood, liver, bile, and intestine.

The model includes four compartments: Blood, liver, bile, and intestine.

In the liver, it is conjugated by UGT1A1, then eliminated via biliary secretion (via MRP2) or into the blood (via MRP3) for renal excretion. In the intestine, conjugated bilirubin (BDG and BMG) converts to unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) through microbial action, which either re‐enters circulation or is excreted as urobilinogen (Urb) in feces.

The current mechanistic model elucidates how changes in the activity of these transporters and enzymes impact blood bilirubin levels, providing a framework for interpreting clinical data and predicting patient‐specific susceptibility to hyperbilirubinemia.</p></sec><sec id="psp470037-sec-0023"><label>4.2</label><title>Evaluations of Therapy‐Induced Hyperbilirubinemia</title><p>Treatment with nilotinib results in elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in pediatric and adult patients, primarily due to UGT1A1 inhibition, with UGT1A1 polymorphisms as risk factors for this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0044">44</xref>]. Model simulations elucidated the relationship between nilotinib‐induced unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and UGT1A1 mutations on the risk of elevated blood bilirubin levels. A prior Phase I study showed that higher doses of nilotinib are associated with a higher grade of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0045">45</xref>], and model simulations with nilotinib trough plasma concentrations qualitatively align with the increased bilirubin levels observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="psp470037-fig-0004">4A</xref>). However, some patients experienced higher grades (&gt; 3‐fold increase compared to baseline), suggesting the involvement of additional risk factors. The model effectively assesses the impact of the UGT1A1 mutation on higher toxicity grades (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="psp470037-fig-0004">4B</xref>). Thus, the current model provides a framework for understanding nilotinib‐induced toxicity in patients with known clinical risk factors.</p><p>Model simulations were also used to evaluate the potential for hyperbilirubinemia in patients treated with varying clinical doses of nelfinavir, atazanavir, and TAK875, based on in vitro data of their inhibitory effects on UGT1A1, OATP1B1, and MRP2. Nelfinavir and atazanavir primarily inhibit UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, while TAK875 is a potent inhibitor of MRP2. The simulations evaluated atazanavir‐induced hyperbilirubinemia and predicted over a 1.5‐fold increase in TUCB across all doses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="psp470037-fig-0005">5</xref>). Hyperbilirubinemia is the most common side effect of atazanavir, affecting over 80% of patients treated with either 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0047">47</xref>]. The incidence of Grade 3 toxicity is 26% with a 400 mg/day dose, while Grade 4 (&gt; 5 times ULN) toxicity is rare, occurring in 1% of patients in the 400 mg/day dosage group and in only 3% of patients with a 600 mg/day dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0047">47</xref>]. Several factors contributing to higher blood bilirubin levels have been identified, including increased hemolysis, higher CD4+ T‐cell counts, abnormal baseline bilirubin levels, ritonavir coadministration, and polymorphism at the multidrug resistance gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0049">49</xref>]. More mechanistic data are needed to understand these associations.</p><p>The simulations revealed no significant increase in blood bilirubin levels with nelfinavir and TAK‐875 across all doses tested, consistent with observations in most patients. Approximately 1.6% of patients treated with 25 mg and 50 mg doses of TAK‐875 experienced &gt; 2× ULN in total blood bilirubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0025">25</xref>]. In a preclinical model, administering a 1000 mg/kg/day IV dose of TAK‐875 resulted in a ninefold increase in total blood bilirubin compared with control rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0027">27</xref>]. Additionally, the intracellular concentration of TAK‐875 is significantly elevated in HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0050">50</xref>], and the concentration of the TAK‐875 metabolite (TAK‐875 AG) in the liver is notably higher than in the blood in rats (liver/blood ratio: 14) and dogs (liver/blood ratio: 23) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0027">27</xref>]. However, the accumulation of TAK‐875 in human tissues is not reported, likely due to the lack of direct human tissue sampling data. The current work aimed to explore the mechanistic basis of hyperbilirubinemia rather than the causes of DILI. However, this approach may provide insights into potential mechanisms contributing to bilirubin elevations observed in such cases.</p><p>Model‐based uncertainty analysis concerning the free drug concentration and tissue accumulation highlighted scenarios where variations in free concentration and tissue accumulation of TAK‐875 might increase blood bilirubin levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="psp470037-fig-0006">6</xref>). This variability is often expected with highly protein‐bound drugs and in different disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="psp470037-bib-0051">51</xref>]. Therefore, the current model enables the assessment if uncertainties in tissue‐free concentration pose a risk for hyperbilirubinemia.</p></sec><sec id="psp470037-sec-0024"><label>4.3</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The free target concentration of a drug significantly contributes to interindividual variability in drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia. Nonetheless, empirical modeling of drug‐free concentrations remains limited in this study, necessitating the inclusion of drug metabolism considerations to fully assess the impact of variations in drug metabolic enzymes on target concentrations. Additionally, hyperbilirubinemia caused by hepatocellular diseases such as autoimmune‐mediated hepatitis is not addressed in this work. These aspects will be incorporated into future research efforts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="psp470037-sec-0025" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>We developed a mechanistic model of human bilirubin metabolism consisting of key processes in the synthesis of bilirubin, its hepatic transport, and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form conjugated bilirubin, and the hepatic and renal elimination of conjugated bilirubin. The model can assess hyperbilirubinemia risk by integrating in vitro drug inhibition and pharmacogenomic data. It can predict bilirubin disposition in healthy individuals as well as in individuals with genetic diseases such as Gilbert's syndrome, which is associated with mutations in the UGT1A1 gene, and Dubin–Johnson syndrome linked to mutations in the MRP2 gene. Model simulations of the role of albumin–bilirubin affinity on free and bound bilirubin were shown to correlate with clinical results. The roles of OATP1B1, UGT1A1, and MRP2 activity on blood unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin levels were identified using sensitivity analysis. Evaluations of the potential for hyperbilirubinemia with nilotinib, nelfinavir, atazanavir, and TAK‐875 using simulations aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, the model demonstrated the role of UGT1A1 polymorphisms as a risk factor in hyperbilirubinemia development in nilotinib‐treated patients. Insights into the impact of uncertainty in hepatic drug‐free concentrations on hyperbilirubinemia, a major contributor to interindividual variation in drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia, were explored using model simulations of TAK‐875. These insights will enhance the prognostic value of bilirubin as a marker for OATP1B1 and UGT1A1 activities.</p></sec><sec id="psp470037-sec-0026"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>R.K., A.K., Y.M., and J.W. wrote the manuscript.
