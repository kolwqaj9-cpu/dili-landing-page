This review systematically summarizes the pathogenesis, diagnostic advancements, and therapeutic strategies for PA-induced HSOS. Molecular mechanisms of PA metabolism are detailed, encompassing cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation and the subsequent formation of pyrrole-protein adducts, which trigger sinusoidal endothelial cell injury and hepatocyte apoptosis. Advances in diagnostic criteria, including the Nanjing Criteria and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM)-integrated Drum Tower Severity Scoring System, are discussed. Furthermore, emerging biomarkers, such as circulating microRNAs and pyrrole-protein adducts, are examined. Imaging modalities, such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have evolved from descriptive tools into quantitative and prognostic instruments. Therapeutic approaches have evolved from supportive care to precision interventions, including anticoagulation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and autophagy-modulating agents. A comprehensive literature review, utilizing databases such as PubMed and Web of Science, was conducted to summarize progress since the introduction of the “Nanjing Guidelines”.

Introduction</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Gynura segetum</italic> (Lour.) Merr. (GS), a perennial herb of the Asteraceae family, is widely recognized in China by its common names “Tu-San-Qi” or “Ju-San-Qi”. Its medicinal use in China dates back to the Ming Dynasty, where its traditional therapeutic properties were reported to include promoting blood circulation, achieving hemostasis, detoxification, and alleviating edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-molecules-31-00410">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-molecules-31-00410">2</xref>]. However, reports of <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic>-associated hepatotoxicity have been prevalent. This toxicity is primarily attributed to its pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) content, as established in various studies, placing PAs among the most frequent causes of herb-induced liver injury (HILI) in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-molecules-31-00410">3</xref>]. Critically, studies have indicated that a single ingestion of as little as 10 g of GS can induce liver injury, which may rapidly progress to severe hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), also known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-molecules-31-00410">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-molecules-31-00410">5</xref>].</p><p>In Western countries, HSOS is most commonly reported as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with an incidence typically ranging from 5% to 20% and a mortality rate exceeding 80% in severe cases. The principal pathogenic mechanism, as detailed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-molecules-31-00410">6</xref>], involves sinusoidal endothelial detachment and swelling induced by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, leading to sinusoidal blockage. In contrast, ingestion of PA-containing herbal remedies constitutes the predominant etiology in China and several other Asian regions. Studies have consistently documented <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> and its closely related “Tu-San-Qi” species as major causative agents for HSOS, primarily owing to their high PA content. As reported by Lin, G et al., the defining histopathological feature is selective injury to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which results in non-thrombotic occlusion of sinusoids and subsequent post-sinusoidal portal hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-molecules-31-00410">4</xref>]. Clinically, the disease typically manifests with acute right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, and rapid weight gain resulting from fluid retention. To date, no specific antidote for PA-induced HSOS has been identified. Progression to hepatic failure is associated with a markedly elevated mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-molecules-31-00410">7</xref>], underscoring the critical importance of early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and immediate cessation of toxin exposure.</p><p>Diagnosing PA-HSOS remains challenging. This diagnostic complexity arises because many patients lack a definitive history of exposure to PA-containing substances. Furthermore, the clinical presentation of PA-induced HSOS is known to overlap with other conditions that manifest sinusoidal portal hypertension, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome and right heart failure, which operate through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Currently, no effective pharmacological therapy has been established to reverse the hepatotoxicity of <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> or restore hepatic parenchymal integrity. The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and herb-induced liver injury (HILI) is further hampered by the absence of reliable biomarkers for routine clinical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-molecules-31-00410">8</xref>]. Alarmingly, a recent case report highlighted a four-year-old child who developed PA-HSOS after accidental ingestion of GS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-molecules-31-00410">9</xref>], underscoring the urgent need to raise public awareness of its potential toxicity. While comprehensive reviews have addressed the general mechanisms and global aspects of 1,2-unsaturated PA-induced HSOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-molecules-31-00410">10</xref>], the majority of cases in China and Asia are specifically attributed to <italic toggle="yes">Gynura segetum</italic> (“Tu-San-Qi”). This specific etiology presents unique challenges in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. However, recent advances since 2021—including the Drum Tower Severity Scoring System, quantitative imaging biomarkers, and targeted therapies—have not been systematically reviewed within this specific context. This review aims to fill this critical gap by providing a focused update on <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic>-induced PA-HSOS. It emphasizes molecular mechanisms, diagnostic refinements, and therapeutic strategies to guide clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Gynura segetum</italic> (GS) possesses a long therapeutic history as a medicinal plant but poses a significant risk of severe hepatotoxicity. Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), induced by its pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) components, represents a complex pathological process spanning botany, toxicology, and clinical medicine. Drawing upon a systematic literature search of scholarly databases (e.g., PubMed and Web of Science), this review synthesizes advancements and insights related to PA-HSOS, particularly those reported since the inception of the “Nanjing Guidelines”. Specifically, it summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying PA-induced hepatotoxicity, current diagnostic strategies (encompassing conventional criteria and emerging biomarkers), and potential therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, this review aims to provide insights that enhance the understanding and management of this clinically challenging disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-31-00410"><title>2. Food and Pharmaceutical Safety Recommendations Regarding PAs</title><p>The first documented case of PA-induced HSOS occurred in 1920, linked to the consumption of PA-contaminated wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-molecules-31-00410">11</xref>]. Since then, numerous reports have documented PA-related safety issues globally, encompassing countries such as Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States, with an estimated 8160 poisoning cases recorded to date. This substantial public health burden has subsequently prompted many countries to establish regulations restricting or prohibiting the use of PA-containing herbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-molecules-31-00410">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-molecules-31-00410">13</xref>]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PAs as carcinogenic substances. Existing literature indicates that over 660 PAs have been identified across more than 6000 plant species. These compounds function as naturally occurring phytotoxins, serving as chemical defenses against herbivores, and are prevalent in thousands of species from families including Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, and Fabaceae. Many PA-containing plants are either utilized medicinally or serve as contaminants in food products such as honey, tea, and cereals, thus posing a significant public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-molecules-31-00410">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-molecules-31-00410">15</xref>]. PAs naturally coexist with their more water-soluble N-oxides (PAN-oxides). The ratio between these forms is known to fluctuate within a single plant species, influenced by environmental conditions and growth stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-31-00410">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-molecules-31-00410">17</xref>]. In response to these concerns, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has implemented systematic monitoring and established regulatory limits for PAs and PAN-oxides in contaminated foods to maintain minimal concentrations throughout the food chain. EFSA also established a reference point of 237 µg/kg body weight per day to assess the carcinogenic risk associated with PA exposure. Their assessment concluded that PAs may pose health concerns for regular consumers of tea and herbal infusions, particularly among younger populations. Similarly, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) proposed the inclusion of Senecio-containing products on the list of prohibited substances. This regulatory action makes the sale, supply, or import of unlicensed oral preparations containing such plants illegal within the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-molecules-31-00410">18</xref>]. However, it is recognized that not all PAs exhibit toxicity, with their harmful potential largely dependent on specific structural features of the molecule. Consequently, a comprehensive international regulatory framework to effectively prevent PA exposure and its associated hepatotoxicity remains to be established.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-31-00410"><title>3. Metabolism of PAs</title><p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are esters comprising a necine base—an amino alcohol characterized by two fused five-membered rings with a shared nitrogen atom—and one or more necic acid moieties. These compounds are known to be toxic to humans and other mammals. PAs are broadly classified into four structural forms based on their N-oxidation state and pyrrolizidine ring saturation: three tertiary amines (saturated, unsaturated, and otonecine types) and one N-oxide form. Key examples include (a) retronecine, (b) heliotridine, (c) otonecine, and (d) platynecine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-31-00410-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Structurally, PA molecules typically feature two fused five-membered rings with a shared nitrogen atom at the C-4 position. Most naturally occurring PAs are derivatives of 1-methylpyrrolizidine; however, some exist as 1-hydroxymethyl-1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine esters, which are known to exhibit hepatotoxic properties. The core structure understood to be responsible for PA-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by an unsaturated necine base containing a 1,2-double bond, one or two hydroxyl groups, and esterified side chains derived from branched necic acids. As established in previous studies, only PAs possessing a 1,2-unsaturated double bond exhibit marked hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity, whereas their saturated analogues are largely non-toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-molecules-31-00410">19</xref>]. This crucial distinction stems from differences in metabolic activation: 1,2-unsaturated PAs undergo bioactivation by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) to generate highly reactive dehydropyrrolizidines (dehydro-PAs). These reactive intermediates then covalently bind to cellular DNA and proteins, which is understood to lead to hepatocyte necrosis, apoptosis, and sinusoidal endothelial injury, ultimately culminating in HSOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-molecules-31-00410">4</xref>].</p><p>Both the roots and aerial parts of <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> contain hepatotoxic PAs at concentrations sufficient to cause liver injury, underscoring that the entire plant should not be consumed as medicine or food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-molecules-31-00410">20</xref>]. The major hepatotoxic PAs identified in <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> are reported to include senecionine, seneciphylline, and integerrimine. Studies have demonstrated their strong binding affinity to hepatic tissue (e.g., 39.22 ± 1.90 nmol/g liver in rats), providing direct evidence that links PA-induced hepatotoxicity to the formation of pyrrole-protein adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-31-00410">21</xref>].</p><p>Following intestinal absorption, PAs are transported to the liver, where they undergo metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (primarily CYP2B and CYP3A) to form dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids (DHPAs). DHPAs are subsequently hydrolyzed to dehydroretronecine (DHR), with both metabolites being highly reactive. These reactive metabolites can conjugate with intracellular glutathione (GSH) to form GSH conjugates, thereby facilitating detoxification of these reactive intermediates. However, the formation of stable pyrrole-protein and pyrrole-DNA adducts by DHPAs and DHR is considered a key molecular event underlying PA-induced hepatotoxicity. These adducts are known to disrupt normal cellular function and initiate oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-molecules-31-00410">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-molecules-31-00410">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-molecules-31-00410">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-molecules-31-00410">24</xref>]. The rate of pyrrole-protein adduct formation serves as a crucial indicator of PA bioactivation. Furthermore, studies have shown that structural diversity among PAs leads to variable toxicity, with diester-type PAs (e.g., lasiocarpine) typically producing the greatest quantity of adducts and exhibiting the highest hepatotoxic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-molecules-31-00410">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-molecules-31-00410">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-molecules-31-00410">27</xref>]. Exposure to PAs is known to induce widespread metabolic disturbances that exhibit time- and dose-dependent patterns, primarily affecting amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism pathways. Specifically, amino acid dysregulation impairs hepatic nitrogen handling. Lipid metabolic disruption results in alterations in arachidonic and linoleic acid pathways, as well as elevations in glycerol and triglycerides, contributing to lipid peroxidation and hepatic injury. Moreover, energy metabolism dysfunction, evidenced by abnormal levels of citric acid and lactate, indicates mitochondrial impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-molecules-31-00410">28</xref>]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which are known to express high levels of CYP450 enzymes but possess limited detoxification capacity, are recognized as the primary targets of PA toxicity. LSEC injury compromises the sinusoidal barrier and causes luminal obstruction, which subsequently produces the characteristic pathology of HSOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-molecules-31-00410">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-molecules-31-00410">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-molecules-31-00410">31</xref>]. Specifically, Chen et al. demonstrated that following repeated administration of <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> extract, PA clearance from liver tissue was markedly slower than from serum, with residues detectable up to eight weeks after the final dose. This observed persistence explains the cumulative toxicity of PAs and the continued progression of disease even after discontinuation, thereby underscoring the importance of long-term clinical follow-up in affected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-molecules-31-00410">32</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-31-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the specific process of hepatic toxin absorption, subsequent liver damage, and detoxification.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-31-00410"><title>4. Pathogenesis: From Molecular Events to Pathological Outcomes</title><sec id="sec4dot1-molecules-31-00410"><title>4.1. Establishment of Experimental Models</title><p>In vitro studies using hepatic S9 fractions have demonstrated a shorter biological half-life of PAs in rats compared to humans. In human liver microsomes, PAs are primarily detoxified via UGT1A4-catalyzed N-glucuronidation reactions. By contrast, murine and rat microsomal systems lack this specific detoxification pathway. Consequently, CYP450-mediated bioactivation of PAs occurs at significantly higher rates in rodents than in humans, which amplifies their susceptibility to PA-induced hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-molecules-31-00410">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-molecules-31-00410">34</xref>]. Rodent models of PA-induced HSOS exhibit pathological features closely resembling those observed in human HSOS. Due to their higher metabolic activation rate and comparable histopathological manifestations, mice have become the preferred species for PA-HSOS model establishment. Male rodents are particularly suited for PA-induced HSOS models, as sex hormones drive high hepatic expression of CYP3A and CYP2C11 enzymes. The synergistic activity of these enzymes markedly enhances PA metabolic activation, enabling the generation of sufficient reactive metabolites even at relatively low exposure doses. This process reproducibly induces characteristic HSOS pathology.

Following intestinal absorption, PAs are transported to the liver, where their metabolic activation is predominantly catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP3A and CYP2B), generating reactive dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids (DHPAs). DHPAs are subsequently hydrolyzed to dehydroretronecine (DHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-31-00410">16</xref>].

Hepatocyte Death: Mitochondrial Apoptosis and Autophagy Imbalance</title><p>Hepatocellular death induced by PA exposure is known to involve both mitochondrial apoptosis and disrupted autophagic regulation. PA exposure promotes the recruitment of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to mitochondria, leading to excessive mitochondrial fission and fragmentation.

The ensuing burst of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) further amplifies apoptotic signaling, as reported by Wang, W et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41-molecules-31-00410">41</xref>].

Evolution of the Diagnostic Framework: From Clinical Criteria to Precision Biomarkers</title><sec id="sec5dot1-molecules-31-00410"><title>5.1. Establishment and Optimization of Clinical Diagnostic Standards</title><p>The “Nanjing Criteria”, proposed by Chinese experts, provide a pivotal foundation for diagnosing PA-HSOS. These established criteria emphasize four key elements: (1) a documented history of PA exposure; (2) characteristic clinical manifestations including abdominal distension, right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and ascites; (3) abnormal liver function tests; and (4) typical radiologic findings. As outlined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49-molecules-31-00410">49</xref>], a comparison with the revised Seattle and Baltimore criteria reveals that the Nanjing criteria incorporate PA exposure history and radiological features, while eliminating requirements for weight gain and specific bilirubin thresholds. This approach enhances their alignment with the clinical manifestations of PA-HSOS. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is a widely recognized structured framework for evaluating the causal relationship in suspected cases of HILI. Considered the gold standard for causality assessment worldwide, RUCAM enables objective scoring to achieve gradings of probable or highly probable. This method rigorously excludes alternative causes, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver diseases, or other confounders. However, a critical limitation arises if RUCAM is not utilized, as this may result in misdiagnosis where liver injury is erroneously linked to PAs rather than other causes. Conversely, studies suggest that integrating RUCAM with specific biomarkers and criteria, such as the Nanjing Criteria, enhances diagnostic accuracy and is strongly advocated for future validations and clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50-molecules-31-00410">50</xref>]. A recent diagnostic and prognostic advance is the development of the Drum Tower Severity Score (DTSS). The DTSS system assigns points based on four established parameters: aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, fibrinogen, and portal vein peak velocity. Each parameter is scored according to its value, resulting in a total score ranging from 4 to 16. Patients categorized with mild severity (4–6 points) show a good response to anticoagulation therapy, reportedly exhibiting a negative predictive value as high as 88%. For these patients, outpatient anticoagulation and biweekly follow-up are recommended within the DTSS framework. For those with moderate severity (7–10 points), approximately 45.6% of cases demonstrate no response to anticoagulation; thus, hospitalization and close monitoring are advised, with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) intervention considered if the initial therapy proves ineffective. In severe cases (11–16 points), the probability of non-response to anticoagulation is 78.3%, leading to a recommendation for direct TIPS to prevent clinical deterioration. As developed by Wang, X et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51-molecules-31-00410">51</xref>] the DTSS system accurately predicts the non-response rate to the foundational regimen of supportive care plus anticoagulation. It enables early stratification of disease severity and provides an objective, quantitative tool for guiding clinical decisions—such as identifying high-risk patients who may require early escalation to TIPS—thereby facilitating more precise management of PA-HSOS.

Advances in Quantitative and Functional Imaging Diagnosis</title><p>Imaging plays an indispensable role in the diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognostic evaluation of PA-HSOS. With advancements in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly the integration of quantitative imaging analysis, diagnostic radiology has evolved from traditional morphological observation toward functional and precision-based quantification. This paradigm shift provides objective and reproducible diagnostic support that complements and extends the capabilities of conventional clinical tools, such as the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) scale and the early “Nanjing Criteria.” Contrast-enhanced CT has emerged as a pivotal modality for identifying and grading PA-HSOS. A large-scale retrospective study by Kan, X. et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52-molecules-31-00410">52</xref>] involving 71 patients with PA-HSOS and 222 controls systematically characterized its hallmark CT features: heterogeneous low attenuation of the liver parenchyma (100%), patchy enhancement (92.96%), and hepatic vein narrowing (87.32%). These objective imaging markers, identified in the aforementioned study, strengthen the imaging component of the Nanjing diagnostic framework, enhancing both consistency and clinical applicability. The same study further demonstrated that contrast-enhanced CT outperforms the traditional Seattle criteria in overall diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>Quantitative CT analysis enables an objective assessment of disease burden and severity. Notably, Wang, C et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53-molecules-31-00410">53</xref>] innovatively applied a threshold-based region-growing algorithm to segment PA-HSOS lesions and calculate the lesion-to-liver volume ratio. Their findings indicated that this ratio showed a strong positive correlation with serum ALT, AST, total bilirubin levels, and clinical severity scores. As a quantitative imaging biomarker, this ratio provides a reproducible and intuitive metric for evaluating disease burden, as described by Wang, C et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53-molecules-31-00410">53</xref>] It also compensates for the non-quantitative limitations of RUCAM and the Nanjing Criteria in grading disease severity, thereby offering a more data-driven foundation for treatment planning and prognostic prediction.</p><p>The functional role of MRI-specific hepatobiliary contrast agents provides unique insights that enhance both diagnostic precision and prognostic evaluation in PA-HSOS. Specifically, Guo, T et al.

In their study, all patients exhibited heterogeneous hypointensity of the hepatic parenchyma during the hepatobiliary phase (HBP). This finding reflected impaired hepatocellular function and offered functional imaging evidence for diagnosis. Notably, Guo et al. also observed that the severity of HBP hypointensity correlated positively with prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR). Furthermore, it was identified as an independent predictor of mortality.</p><p>This finding represents a pivotal transition—positioning imaging not merely as a diagnostic modality, but as a quantitative and functional tool for prognostic prediction, extending beyond the capabilities of RUCAM and the exposure-based Nanjing Criteria.</p><p>This collective evidence positions imaging not merely as a diagnostic modality but as a quantitative and functional tool for prognostic prediction, extending capabilities beyond those of RUCAM and the exposure-based Nanjing Criteria. Collectively, quantitative CT and functional MRI have ushered PA-HSOS diagnosis into a new era of precision and quantification. Future investigations should therefore focus on: (1) integrating objective imaging parameters (e.g., lesion-to-liver volume ratio, HBP signal intensity) into diagnostic and grading systems to compensate for the non-quantitative limitations of RUCAM and existing standards; (2) exploring the potential of radiomics to uncover latent pathological patterns and prognostic signatures; and (3) developing multi-modal diagnostic frameworks that combine imaging-based metrics with emerging biomarkers such as pyrrole-protein adducts (PPAs) and circulating microRNAs.

This therapy aims at symptomatic relief and complication prevention, encompassing hepatic function stabilization, ascites control, coagulation improvement, and infection prevention. For patients with rapidly progressive disease or poor response to standard management, the guidelines further recommend targeted pharmacologic interventions (e.g., anticoagulants and hemodynamic modulators).

The absence of large-scale, multicenter RCTs to validate specific agents or regimens significantly limits the development of robust evidence-based guidelines.</p><p>Addressing these critical limitations, future challenges should focus on the following:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Integrating RUCAM, pyrrole-protein adduct detection, and DTSS into multimodal frameworks for accurate causality and severity assessment.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Conducting prospective, multicenter RCTs to establish optimal anticoagulation timing, TIPS indications, and the efficacy of novel therapies.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Standardizing botanical identification (e.g., DNA barcoding, chemical fingerprinting) to prevent <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic> confusion with other “San-Qi” herbs.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p>Enhancing public awareness and regulatory enforcement to curb misuse.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(5)</label><p>Investigating systemic effects (e.g., gut-liver axis, immunosuppression, pulmonary toxicity) for a comprehensive understanding of long-term sequelae and broader patient impact.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Addressing these historical shortcomings and emerging challenges will be crucial to advancing the precision management of <italic toggle="yes">G. segetum</italic>-related PA-HSOS and improving patient outcomes. Ultimately, a concerted and collaborative effort from scientific, clinical, and regulatory bodies is imperative to eradicate this preventable liver injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to all the developers of the drawing software FigDraw 2.0.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
